def branch_trajectory():
    """
    How data quality evolves along one branch the user picked out of the graph.

    The branch is named by an edge and an end point: source -> target fixes which way out of source
    the branch leaves, and destination fixes where it stops. The edge is what disambiguates a source
    with more than one child - without it, "everything below source" is several different branches.

    Query: ?source=<node>&target=<node>&destination=<node>
    Returns the branch's node sequence and, per quality dimension, the value series with each step's
    delta and contribution. Reads the metrics cached on each node at creation - nothing is recomputed.
