Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

As recent reports indicate, DOGE has unlawfully accessed student loan records, compromising sensitive borrower information, including mine. 
As a federal student loan borrower, I have the right to privacy regarding my educational and financial records. The unlawful access and potential misuse of my student loan data constitute a serious violation of FERPA. This breach has eroded my trust in the integrity of federal student loan management and has created significant risks, including identity theft, unauthorized loan modifications, and financial harm. 
Given the egregious nature of this breach, I formally demand that the CFPB take the following immediate actions : XXXX. Full discharge and forgiveness of my federal student loans due to the governments failure to protect my data. 
XXXX. A formal confirmation of whether my records were accessed or compromised. 
XXXX. A full report on how my data has been handled during this breach. 
XXXX. Immediate enforcement actions against those responsible for this violation.

This FERPA violation constitutes gross negligence by the Department of Education and DOGE, directly impacting my financial and personal security. Due to the governments failure to safeguard my data, I am no longer obligated to repay these loans and demand full forgiveness. 

Please confirm receipt of this demand and provide a timeline for loan forgiveness and resolution.

I contacted Mohela and asked them if this would impact my payments for my public service loan forgiveness. I was informed to know that that would have no impact. I advised them I did not want to be placed in forbearance as my loan was due on the XXXX, the forbearance was placed on the XXXX, and the account migration should be done in plenty of time to be able to make my payment without incurring a late fee. Mohela agreed and said that I should be able to make my payment once the migration was done and that they would remove the forbearance. That did not happen. I submitted my PSLF forms which have been denied repeatedly because that XXXX payment has not been applied due to the forbearance that I was involuntarily placed that was unnecessary for my account. The letter received from Mohela informed me that This would have no impact upon my loan. Yet it has prevented me from public service loan forgiveness. I made my payment on XX/XX/year>. Thus my loans should be forgiven or in the process of public service loan forgiveness. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Mohela once again and their staff informed me that they would remove the forbearance for XXXX and XXXX in order for me to be allowed to be considered for forgiveness. That still has not happened. I've been repeatedly lied to by staff at Mohela. I've tried everything in my power to try to resolve this issue including requesting a reconsideration which nothing has happened with, requesting to be placed back into repayment so I could make my one payment in order to have my loans forgiven nothing has happened with it either. I have requested to buy back a month and that application has not been processed. I have also requested reconsideration of my payment counts and nothing has progressed with it. I have submitted at least 11 complaints to try to resolve this issue. I have made 122 payments on this loan. My loan should have been forgiven months ago I want this escalated to the Department of Education. Not to mention I have filed three complaints with the OIG. I have made numerous phone calls and contacted both the servicer and XXXX XXXX designated communication methods. 
As I have been actively trying to resolve this issue for 6 months. I am requesting immediate discharge of my student loans due to servicer misconduct and based upon the misconduct of The Department of Education Student Aid Department. Their website specifically states this account migration will not impact my loans ' forgiveness and yet it has due to the denial of the XXXX Payment for MOHELA 's involuntary placement of my account in forbearance. I have filed an OIG complaint that also includes screenshots of the Student Aid Website 's information about Mohela 's account migration. Along with proof of payment made with my bank statement, and a screen shot of payment counts from Mohela 's website.

Because is has been month of delinquency, per Mohela, they have now sent me a delinquency cascading letter as a threat. 

Please note that I have reached out to Mohela to clarify this issue to no avail, as they have high call volume over 30 minutes with no customer service specialist answering the phone and with no response online after I sent a message to them addressing this issue.

01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"First thing this company ( Mohela ) did is rescind my student loan forgiveness that occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. They rescinded my student loan forgiveness on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX after forgiveness and after it was reported to the three credit bureaus stating that my student loans have been paid in full. Still don't understand how this is allowed to happen, but here we are almost XXXX XXXX later and nothing has been done. You all are still a bunch of crooks and only care about the bottom line and not helping out borrowers. 

Fast forward to the month of XX/XX/XXXX and I have been placed on Forbearance because my loans are associated with the XXXX XXXX and because this nonsense is currently being handled by the judicial system because some state Republican Attorney Generals decided to sue the XXXX XXXX on the XXXX XXXX and they think it's okay to mess with the lives of working Americans currently in student loan debt ( they want us to be in debt forever ). I received a letter/email correspondence on XX/XX/XXXX via my Mohela account stating I am on Forbearance due to being on the XXXX XXXX and no interest will accrue on my account starting on XX/XX/XXXX. Though I called Mohela several times asking when the interest will stop accruing on my account, I was told "" it takes time and it needs to be done manually and the interest will be added back after a review is done. '' I made three payments : one on XX/XX/XXXX, another on XX/XX/XXXX, and a third on XX/XX/XXXX. The three payments have interest associated with them even though I wasn't supposed to have interest accruing on my student loan account. I called Mohela several times to resolve this issue. The last phone call I had about this issue ( I don't remember the date because I have just stopped collecting the dates I have communicated with this crooked company ) with Mohela was with a BRAND NEW Mohela employee. I asked when the interest that was collected will be taken off the principal balance. The BRAND NEW employee stated she is not equipped to do this and "" I need to transfer you to a supervisor. '' I got transferred after talking with the BRAND NEW useless Mohela employee and was on hold for almost an HOUR! I hung up because nobody was going to help me and they weren't going to reflect the interest that accrued back on my principal balance. 

They also added additional interest that was pending for one of the loans to the principal balance after interest stopped accruing at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. The total interest they states was "" unpaid '' is {$84.00}. This "" unpaid '' interest shouldn't even be on my principal balance since it was accrued during my Forbearance period. I am on Forbearance because I am on the XXXX XXXX and I should NOT be paying interest. 

My current principal is estimated at {$77000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. In my payment history of my Mohela account. Right now, the principal balance SHOULD be at {$76000.00}. 

Let me type this again so that it is not missed, interest stopped accruing on my account at the END OF XX/XX/XXXX when it was supposed to STOP accruing on XX/XX/XXXX. And Mohela added an additional {$84.00} of accrued "" unpaid '' interest back to my principal balance without notifying me. They thought I would not notice the balance change and I know you all are going to come up with some B.S. excuse about it. 

So, to summarize, I was on XXXX forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX. Called Mohela to verify and they stated it the 0 % interest needed to be done manually and that the interest will be reflected on my balance once the 0 % interest has been made to my account. I made three payments with interest associated with them and the interest is not reflected on my principal balance due to Mohela 's incompetence. And there is no record of them putting the interest back on my principal balance. When interest stopped accruing on my account at the end of XXXX, there was {$84.00} of accrued "" unpaid '' interest that was then added to my principal balance sometime towards the end of XXXX. I have called multiple times and no action has been taken. It has been almost XXXXXXXX XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IL,60637,None,Consent provided,Web,01/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11373860

Despite numerous attempts to resolve these matters, I have yet to receive any satisfactory response or resolution. 
Firstly, I have been unable to reach MOHELA by phone. Each time I call, I am met with excessively long wait times, only to be disconnected or transferred without ever speaking to a representative. This lack of customer support is unacceptable and has caused me significant inconvenience. 
Secondly, my online account with MOHELA was abruptly canceled without any prior notice or explanation. This has left me unable to access my account information, email or manage my account effectively. I rely on the online portal to stay informed, view my payment history and communication with MOHELA via secure email, and its cancellation has been highly disruptive. 
Most concerningly, I have made several payments in 2024 that were not applied to my account as my account was moved to the Department of Education. These payments have not been refunded, and I have no clear understanding of their status. This situation has caused unnecessary financial strain and anxiety. 
I request that these issues be addressed immediately : 1. Provide a reliable and accessible phone support system to ensure that customers can reach a representative without undue delay.

2. Restore my online account or provide a clear explanation for its cancellation, along with instructions on how I can communicate with MOHELA via secure email as telephone calls are not timely answered.

3. Refund the payments made in 2024 that were not applied to my account and provide a detailed account statement reflecting payments applied to my loan balance prior to transferring to Department of Education.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IL,62269,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,02/16/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12097152

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 
I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : XXXX. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ). 
XXXX. My Free Application for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
XXXX. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization. 
These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

4. Immediate notification to XXXX  XXXX  credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach.

This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties. 
I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your immediate response and resolution.

On or around XX/XX/year>, I became aware that individuals associated with Elon Musk, who are neither school officials nor authorized representatives, accessed databases that include my personal education records without my knowledge or consent. I am aware that usage of databases is monitored, recorded and/or subjected to audit. I did not provide any authorization for such access, and I believe this constitutes a violation of my FERPA rights.

To my understanding, the Department of Education is required to safeguard students personal records and only grant access to authorized parties under FERPA guidelines. The unauthorized access by private individuals or corporate representatives is a serious breach of these protections.

A complaint has been filed with the US Department of Education Student Privacy Policy Office, Federal Student Aid ( FSA ), the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Ohio Attorney General, and my current loan holder. 

I respectfully request that your office investigate this matter and take the appropriate action to ensure my personal information remains protected.

My personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization, which constitutes a breach of confidentiality and a direct violation of multiple federal laws protecting student records and personal data.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ensures the confidentiality of student records, and this breach represents a clear violation of my rights under this law. Additionally, the Privacy Act of 1974 establishes a code of fair information practices governing the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personal information by federal agencies. The unauthorized access and potential misuse of my data directly contradict these protections.

Furthermore, Higher Education Laws and Policies exist to safeguard future borrowers from improper data sharing and unauthorized access. Allowing a third-party entity, specifically Elon Musk , to access and use student loan data without proper authorization is a severe breach of these legal standards. This unauthorized access not only jeopardizes my financial security but also sets a dangerous precedent for future borrowers. 

Given the severity of this breach and the compromise of my personal and financial information, I demand an immediate investigation into this matter. I also request the full cancellation and discharge of my student loan due to the mishandling of my data, which has resulted in a significant breach of my privacy rights. 
I expect a prompt response detailing the actions being taken to address this issue and ensure that such breaches do not occur in the future. Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide me with updates regarding the investigation and resolution.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",TX,75090,None,Consent provided,Web,02/10/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12004702

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 
I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ).

2. My Free Application for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
XXXX. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization. 
These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information.

Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. 
2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

4. Immediate notification to XXXX XXXX  credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach. 
This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties. 
I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above.

02/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am writing to formally address a significant issue regarding the unauthorized consolidation of my federal student loan and its impact on my eligibility for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) program. While I have no issue fulfilling my obligation to repay my loan, I am deeply concerned about the unauthorized actions taken by XXXX XXXX ( now MOHELA ) that have adversely affected my loan terms and PSLF progress. 

Specifically, my XXXX XXXX Loan in the amount of {$24000.00}, originated on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX was consolidated by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, without my consent or knowledge. There is no master promissory note or any documentation in existence that reflects my authorization for this consolidation. As a result of this action, the terms of my loan were altered, including an increase in the interest rate from 2.5 % to 3.5 %. Furthermore, the loan was transferred to a different account on XX/XX/XXXX, again without my approval or awareness. 

This unauthorized consolidation has caused significant harm, including the loss of qualifying payments toward XXXX. I have been making consistent payments under the XXXX program, which should have been counted as qualifying payments. However, due to the unjustified consolidation, these payments were not credited correctly. The only action I took in XX/XX/XXXX2017 was recertifying my income-driven repayment plan, which should not have triggered a consolidation or altered my loan disbursement date. 

Upon discovering this error in XX/XX/XXXX2018, I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, I was informed that the consolidation could not be reversed, nor could my original disbursement date be restored. While XXXX XXXX offered to reduce the new interest rate by XXXX percentage point, this adjustment still left me with a higher rate than my original 2.5 %. Additionally, XXXX XXXX assured me that eligible payments would be credited toward XXXX. However, since the transfer of my loan to a new servicer, these commitments have not been honored. 

To date, I have not received any documentation, including a master promissory note or other supporting materials, that verifies my consent for the consolidation of my loan. This lack of documentation further underscores the unauthorized nature of this action.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CO,80602,None,Consent provided,Web,02/20/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12149576

XXXX ISSUES First, ( in XXXX ) they prevented me from putting back a class that was acidentally dropped, ( unformalized understanding of online portal and lack of safe guards to prevent or confirm drop class confirmation options ). 
Second ( in XXXX ), They enrolled me in a Spanish class that required student to pay for access to a special application from a external vender, knowing I told them I was homeless, unemployed, and walking to school for lack of money. 
Third, ( In XXXX ), XXXX debt of - {$1500.00}, for the accidentally Dropped class, when it states full refund due to class was dropped timely. Then when I disbuted thier claim of why I owed, they changed it to I owed it for purchases from the school store, which is false, due to them taking, or should have taken it out of my active loan. 

XXXX The school continued their retaliation in my new school year XXXX by placing me on academic probation for not failing classes ( XXXXXXXX XXXX class ), I could not access due to lack of funds and homelessness, so this means I must obtain passing grades in all my XXXX classes, but my test records clearly shows I lack knowlege of many subject areas and require tutoring.

Now they will use the academic issue to hold up my credit balance distribution, again. 
I have found many other students who have received this same treatment from this school, the stealing of our money then using their unfair polices to remove the student or prevent payout of the students credit balance, but they always deduct the money we owe for their classes and school store credit purchases for books and computers, needed for classes.

I continued to make payments throughout, taking advantage of the 0 % interest rate. On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I had made a {$1400.00} payment towards my final loan that brought my total owed down to {$2100.00}. Under my loan details, that was the balance showed until XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  when I made a final payment in full of the {$2100.00}. Once that payment had cleared on XX/XX/XXXX, I showed a balance of {$0.00}. 

On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I logged into the account to see if I had any notification of final payment or the loan being paid in full, and I noticed that I now owed a balance of {$17.00}. I used the chat function within the website, and was quickly greeted by a representative. She would check back in every few minutes to say she was researching my account, then ended the chat without answering any questions. I was able to get another representative ( XXXX ), and she informed me that my outstanding balance as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  was {$2200.00}. I told her that was not the information I was provided, and explained that just the day prior I showed a balance of {$0.00}. She said that she was sorry, but the only way for the account to be closed was to pay the {$17.00}. I ended the chat with her and called the direct line. 

Once on the phone, I notified the new representative that I would record the call for my records. She had told me the same thing as XXXX, but this time when I explained the situation further, she said she would talk with a team lead. After a brief hold, they were able to remedy the situation and re-XXXX  my account back out. They mentioned that there was a software glitch that caused payments to not be reported on their end. 

My concern is that if I would have just listened to the first two representatives, I would have had to pay the new balance due. It was not a large amount by any means, but {$17.00} spread out over millions of borrowers could result in MILLIONS stolen from customers at no fault of their own.

This unexplained increase raises concerns about potential mismanagement or errors in Aidvantages loan servicing.

Additionally, I request that Aidvantage provide a full and transparent explanation of this {$100.00} increase and correct my balance if this charge was applied in error.

01/23/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"To Whom It May Concern, I am filing this complaint against my federal student loan servicer, Mohela, due to issues involving the accuracy of my loan status and unacceptable customer service interactions.

1. Inaccurate Loan Status I have verified with StudentAid.gov that my loans are in forbearance, yet Mohelas records fail to reflect this. This discrepancy creates confusion and potential harm, including the risk of incorrect reporting to credit agencies. 

2. Unprofessional Customer Service When I contacted Mohela on [ insert date ], a representative stated, I dont care in response to my concern. Additionally, after requesting to escalate the matter to a manager, I received a callback from someone who was not a manager, which prevented proper resolution of my issue.

Impact on Me as a Borrower : Emotional stress from the servicers unprofessional behavior.

Risk of financial harm due to incorrect loan status and potential credit reporting errors.

Actions I Am Seeking : Immediate correction of my loan status to accurately reflect the verified forbearance. 
Written assurance that no adverse credit reporting or financial penalties have occurred as a result of Mohelas error.

Investigation into Mohelas customer service practices to ensure fair treatment of borrowers.

I request the CFPB to investigate this matter and hold Mohela accountable for providing accurate information and professional service. 

Personal Information for Reference : Name : XXXX XXXX Loan Account Number : XXXX Contact Information : XXXX, XXXX Thank you for your assistance in addressing this issue. 

Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called studentaid.gov to verify that my XXXX XXXX application is in review and submitted as of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX did very and stated that I was not supposed to be in a payment status since the application takes 3 years to review so I am automatically in a Forbearance. 
XX/XX/XXXX I called Mohela-the wait time was XXXX and a half hours. I left a message and did not receive a call back. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX I called Mohela- I waited on the line for XXXX for a representative which I had a conversation with XXXX who is ( in the beginner que ). I asked questions about my loan and she stated "" I dont care '' I asked to speak with a supervisor and she transferred me back in the que. I was on the phone for XXXX min. 

XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX Not a manager called me back, gave me info on the process to speak with a supervisor. Went over basic information with me and stated my loan is not in a forbearance and I can apply for that which she could help e with and then the line got disconnect. 

XX/XX/XXXX called Mohela again and requested call back at XXXX hr wait time. I left a message and a trying to speak with a supervisor. I have the previous call recorded for XXXX and will continue to record the calls for my protection. 

I just need to validate my status so I do not receive over due notices which is currently reporting on my credit. Also I am requesting for the Master Promissory note which is not listed on the Student Aid.gov website. 

My main goal was to make sure I am not in a repayment status. This is not right and violates my rights as a consumer with Mohela of which I never had a formal or professional agreement with them in the first place.

We did not find out and were not told until XXXX that XXXX XXXX also had to submit XXXX applications- and that this was the remaining balance now XXXX $ XXXX. She completed the required forms, jumped the hoops ( not an issue as she had put in the time ) and we were told every single time we called in XXXX by MOHELA that "" all looks good, just keep waiting. It's in FSA 's hands now ( Federal Student Aid ) "". We regularly received conflicting information we were placed on endless holds, our calls were dropped. 

We received a forgiveness letter from FSA on XX/XX/XXXX indicating that the remainder of our loans ( $ XXXX ) were to be forgiven- the letter states that they await MOHELA to process this and discharge our loans. MOHELA have said that it "" XXXX not in their hands "" Any day now, just keep waiting for FSA- ''. Since that letter ( correspondence I had to submit to MOHELA myself and they denied for XXXX weeks they even had ) we have had to call MOHELA every other month to extend forbearance until such time whomever or however they decide to XXXX  the balance and we are deemed free form the predatory clutches of MOHELA. Nothing has happened since XX/XX/XXXX and I have thought for months something must be askew. 

TO THE FINAL STRAW and reason for me seeking you : We called XX/XX/XXXX as our forbearance was set to end again XXXX we waited on hold XXXX hours and were curtly told that "" there's nothing we can do you are in forbearance until XXXX call back closer to your loan due date and we will reinstitute the forbearance '' ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

We called yesterday XX/XX/XXXX and held for XXXX hours combined. The only time we actually spoke with a live person after holding XXXX hours- ( XXXX XXXXouldn't help usXXXX didn't have the 'access ' she needed to fulfill our request then had to transfer our call ) phone disconnected after XXXX minutes on their end- they disconnected the call- We called back at XXXX XXXX held XXXX more hours- no answer. No option to put in call back request- slave to sitting waiting for the hold to end and speak to a live person. Didn't happen. We hung up at XXXX as we actually have lives. 

We called again this morning XX/XX/XXXX right before XXXX held for XXXX hours- we were told by MOHELA XXXX you have no more forbearance to be applied- you have a payment due XX/XX/XXXX. '' They stated forbearance was "" up to FSA you need to call them about it we cant do anything- you have a payment due XX/XX/XXXX. '' We plead for more info- got placed on hold at least XXXX  times during which they stated "" I'm conferring with my mentor and asking how to proceed ''. She finally came back on- bottom lined that "" it's not in their hands and we have a payment due XX/XX/XXXX. '' We asked that she put us to a supervisor- she FLAT OUT STATED NO "" You need to call FSA ''. She refused to transfer the call. We asked again to be transferred- she again declined. 

We then called FSA about XXXX XXXX got someone quickly who transferred us to a specialist- she was informative and basically stated that based on the real time information they could see that MOHELA did not have XXXX XXXX in their system and was not correctly reflecting the status of our loans in the registry/ database as they had been joint consolidation loans- they only reflected my info- that her PSFL application essentially had been dropped in XXXX and that this has to be the issue as to why the loans have not been XXXX % discharged. We were told by FSA to call MOHELA back- inform them of their error- to update their records to accurately reflect XXXX XXXX in the registry. Called MOHELA back at XXXX We have been on hold since - XXXX XXXX and I are both on what is stated to be a "" hold time XXXX hours ''. They will not pick up. 

They are using this loophole that they are fully aware of to block our loan being discharged, they simply want our money. They are doing whatever and whenever to put us off. 

XXXX XXXX shows XXXX loans in XXXXSA and as such our process to get her PSLF application and Employee certification forms back in place can not be done on her dashboard ( "" you have no loans that qualify for PLSF '' ). We have since prepared the ECFs for her current qualifying employer with whom she has been since XXXX full time XXXX hour a week. Also have XXXX for her other employer ( also a qualifying XXXX where she was XXXX ). I also contend that the employer she was with from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX qualifies but we have had little luck as they have changed hands a few times. 

Here 's a little kicker : As a result of our overpayment ( anything paid over the XXXX qualifying ) we are owed a refund : it's roughly {$15000.00}. 

Bottom line- she meets the requirements for PSLF as I did- we had the same employers ( except for XXXX comprising XXXX  months which still is a qualifying XXXX ) MOHELA dropped the ball amidst the transfer or somewhere along the way and as a result we have to pay them until this gets sorted or we will take a credit hit. 

Per the XX/XX/XXXX court case XXXX v. MOHELA- this is the regular practice of theirs- they deceive, deflect and derail a loan holders attempts to have their loans discharged. Mohela have had multiple other issues and the Federal government took away their contract for PSLF for a period as they had made such a mess of it. Lets be clear- we have MORE than paid the amount we borrowed as from XXXX XXXX None of those loan payments counted toward PSLF. In XXXX before we hard of PSLF we were resigned to pay on XXXX years of loans. PSLF gave us hope we'd be able to get out form under in XXXX years- and then possibly pursue higher paying jobs in the private sector or different careers altogether- XXXX theme was clear- keep your head down for XXXX  years- pay the monthly payment. We did this. PSLF is a government created program- we arent asking for handouts or crying for something we haven't earned or been explicitly promised. If I had entered private sector work in XXXX when I was supposed to be originally forgiven- I'd be making twice as much as I do now. 

We need ASSISTANCE : someone to intervene and hold this repeat offender and their ongoing willful deflection, misinformation and incompetence that are tantamount to criminal business practices- I am considering taking legal action vs MOHELA. They have caused us immeasurable anxiety and they have greatly truncated our finances. 

-Incessant hold times ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX combined going on XXXX hours ) -Misinformation -Call deflection -Blatant lies If we are enduring this- thousands of others are. This has been haunting us for XXXX  months since we were first declined in XX/XX/XXXX. We stand at the finish line- we now have a son in college ( guess who didn't qualify for financial aid because his dad showed $ XXXX in outstanding student loans? ) - MOHELA are the only barrier between us being done with this page of our lives. They are a horrible company ad they prey on people. This needs to stop.

There have been multiple types of forbearance I have been automatically been in, removed from, etc. There has been so much conflicting information on payments, repayments, etc. It is all incredibly frustrating and I believe my balance and accounts are being mishandled against current policy.

The payment has been reversed from your account for the following reason and your account may now be delinquent: NO ACCOUNT / UNABLE TO LOCATE.

The unable to locate error means we were not able to locate your financial institution.

Your next payment of XXXX will be due on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced several changes and updates that will bring borrowers closer to forgiveness under income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. These adjustments to accounts include conducting a one-time revision of IDR payment counters to address past inaccuracies and permanently fix IDR payment counting by reforming EDs IDR tracking procedures going forward.
 
Based on the newly eligible months from the one-time account adjustment, borrowers who have reached 240 or 300 months (as applicable) worth of payments for IDR forgiveness or 120 months of PSLF will begin to see their loans forgiven in XXXX. The Department will continue to discharge loans as borrowers reach the months needed for forgiveness. All other borrowers will see their accounts update in XXXX.

More information on these upcoming changes is available at: https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment.

Your student loans are in a forbearance. On XXXX XXXX XXXX, a federal court issued a stay preventing the Department of Education (ED)from operating the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) Plan. As a result of this ruling, ED has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance. You can find more information at StudentAid.gov/saveaction.


What does this mean for me?
While you are in this forbearance no payment is required on your account and your interest rate will be set to 0%. This means no interest will accrue while you are in the
Forbearance. You will not receive credit toward IDR forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) for the month(s) covered by the forbearance. If you made or make a payment for the month(s) you are in the forbearance, the amounts paid will go toward satisfying your future payment(s). We will notify you before the forbearance comes to an end. We do not currently have a time estimate. We will then send you your next monthly billing statement at least 21 days before your next monthly payment is due
At this point I was ill. After all the issues I went through to get my payments set up to now not being able to pay them.. So incredibly infuriating. They are my loans and Ive been enrolled in PSLF for years! I should be able to continue paying under the PSLF qualifying plan! 


XXXX  I contacted MOHELA again, because it had been 4 months since I was put on administrative forbearance after FINALLY getting my payment plan ready to go with the new SAVE plan:  
FROM MOHELA:
Thank you for contacting MOHELA,
Although the General Forbearance for borrowers enrolled in SAVE does not count toward PSLF, there are currently two ways borrowers may be able to receive PSLF credit. Borrowers should review these two options closely before taking any action.
1) Buy Back Credit: Some borrowers may be eligible to buy back months of PSLF credit for time spent in forbearance as a result of the courts injunction. Borrowers with 120 months of eligible employment can buy back (make payments to cover) past months that were not counted as qualifying payments because the borrower was in an ineligible deferment or forbearance status. Borrowers must submit a buyback request and make an extra payment of at least as much as what they would have owed under an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan during the months they are trying to buy back.
Borrowers can buy back these months only if:
- they still have an outstanding balance on their loan(s),
- they have approved qualifying employment for these same months, and
- buying back these months will complete their total of 120 qualifying PSLF payments.


This is a new process that ED began making available XXXX XXXXXXXX Learn about eligibility and how to buy back months by visiting XXXXXXXX Note: Borrowers who have consolidation loans can buy back months only on the current consolidation loan. These borrowers cant buy back months from the loans included in the consolidation loan or for any period prior to the first disbursement date of a consolidation loan.


2) Enroll in a different PSLF-eligible repayment plan: Borrowers can apply to enroll in a different PSLF-eligible repayment plan. We encourage borrowers to look at the specific terms of each plan to make the best choice for their individual situation. See above for more information. Different IDR plans may require higher monthly payments than the SAVE Plan does, andin the case of some IDR plansborrowers who later leave them may face interest capitalization (where unpaid interest is added to the principal balance). However, payments made under these IDR plans will count toward forgiveness under IDR and PSLF.Borrowers should expect a lengthy delay in the processing of applications. Further communication will be provided as this develops.


Additional details pertaining to the impacts of this stay will be provided as they become available. You may also visit XXXXXXXX and XXXXXXXX for updates.


If you have any additional questions, please contact us toll free at XXXX. Our hours are XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX.


Thank you,

Original message from me to MOHELA:

I would like to make qualifying payments for PSLF again. When can I do this? Its been XXXX XXXX! 
This is crazy. Im currently on the phone, XXXX XXXX and counting on hold to speak to someone who can assist me. 
Please get back to me soon. 


Thank you,

I received a letter from MOHELA stating interest would continue to accrue on my loans during the administrative forbearance period.  
This is what the letter states: 
BORROWER:
Loan Update:
In an effort to keep you updated on your federal loan(s), we have enclosed details about your loan(s), including the accrued interest, interest rate, and total balance. The loan(s) listed in this letter are currently in forbearance. Although no payments are due at this time, interest continues to accrue on your loan(s) during the forbearance period. You have the option to pay the interest during forbearance. XXXX
I went online to review the latest letter from MOHELA and read about my options. 
I cannot switch to a different qualifying PSLF payment plan because MOHELA and federal student aid states that switching would result in a processing forbearance - so this would put me in the same exact position I am currently in, therefore, its not an option. All information that Ive been given over the years from Mohela representatives via phone or through the website/my messaging about repaying MY OWN student loans is inaccurate or the information is only correct/valid for a few months before it changes again. The ever-changing agreements to my loans and repayment and PSLF causes me an immense amount of stress. It is impacting my mental health and the stress and confusion makes me physically ill. I have to take time off of work XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX) to call MOHELA because the wait times are so long. 


All the months of administrative forbearance I have been placed on while on the SAVE plan should count towards my PSLF qualifying payments, please switch them from ineligible to eligible. From XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, and moving forward, all months that I am still on administrative forbearance should count towards my PSLF qualifying months, too. Since there is no other plan I can apply to without being placed in another processing forbearance (for an unknown amount of time) this is the only fair resolution. Once the above resolutions are in place, I would also like to receive loan terms and PSLF terms that state how many more qualifying payments I need to make to qualify for the final PSLF forgiveness. I would also like to request a date of when my payments of XXXX  will resume.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,WA,986XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11347465

Account Details : Account Statement Date : XX/XX/XXXX Last Payment ( Effective Date ) : XX/XX/XXXX Regular Monthly Payment Amount : {$430.00} Amount Paid Since Last Statement : {$0.00} Past Due Amount : {$880.00} Total Amount Due : {$1300.00} Chronology of Events : Enrollment in SAVE Plan : In XX/XX/XXXX, I collaborated with a MOHELA representative to enroll in the SAVE Plan, resulting in an agreed monthly payment of {$10.00}, no interest, and payments counted towards PSLF. 

Initial Payment : The first payment of {$10.00} was successfully processed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Subsequent Payment Issues : Following the initial payment, I was informed of an injunction affecting the SAVE Plan. Consequently, my monthly payment increased to {$430.00} without prior notification or explanation, leading to account delinquencies. 

Website Notification : Upon accessing the repayment options on my account, I encountered a message stating, "" You are currently in an alternative plan, Contact Us for further assistance. '' Attempts to Resolve the Issue : Phone Calls : Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have made multiple attempts to contact MOHELA 's customer service. Each attempt resulted in extended wait times, often exceeding five hours, without successful resolution. 
Messages : I have left several messages requesting assistance but have not received any responses. 

Impact : The unexpected increase in my monthly payment and the lack of effective communication have caused significant financial strain and stress. The accruing delinquencies on my account are a direct result of these unresolved issues.

Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

Key Details : Date of violation : XX/XX/year> Entity responsible : Federal Student Aid ( FSA ), U.S. Department of Education Issue : Unauthorized access to my personal and financial records without my consent Actions I took : Submitted a formal complaint to the Department of Educations Student Privacy FERPA Office Notified my loan servicer about the unauthorized access Filed a report with Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) to document the potential breach Description of Violation : On XX/XX/year>, I discovered that my student loan records within the Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) system were accessed without my authorization. Under FERPA regulations, FSA is legally required to protect the privacy of student records and restrict access to authorized personnel only. 

If my personally identifiable information ( PII ) including my loan balance, repayment terms, and financial detailswas viewed, shared, or modified without my explicit consent, this constitutes a direct violation of federal law and exposes me to identity theft, fraud, and financial risk. 

Despite my efforts to report this issue and seek clarity, I have not received a satisfactory explanation from FSA regarding : Who accessed my records Why the access occurred What specific information was viewed or modified Impact of the Violation : This breach has caused significant privacy concerns, including : Potential misuse or unauthorized modification of my student loan account.

Loss of trust in FSAs ability to secure borrower data.

Emotional distress due to the mishandling of my private financial information.

Requested Resolution : I request that FSA and the appropriate federal agencies take immediate action to : Conduct a formal investigation into the unauthorized access of my records. 
Provide a written report confirming whether my data was accessed, altered, or disclosed. 
Enhance security measures to prevent future FERPA violations. 
Notify all affected borrowers if their student loan data was improperly accessed. 
Offer compensation or corrective measures if this violation caused financial harm. 
Formal Request for Response : I request a written response within 30 days detailing : The findings of your internal investigation into this breach. 
The corrective actions being implemented to secure borrower data. 
Whether affected borrowers, including myself, will receive compensation or debt relief due to this failure to protect student loan records. 
Failure to properly address this matter may result in additional formal complaints being filed with : The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) The U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) Legal counsel specializing in data privacy violations Conclusion : Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) has a legal and ethical obligation to protect borrower records and comply with FERPA. If my student loan records were improperly accessed, FSA must be held accountable and take immediate corrective action to ensure borrower data security.

Navient repeatedly placed my account in deferment status without my clear understanding or informed consent. While they sent emails requesting that I reply "" yes '' to approve the forbarance, at no point did I have a voice-to-voice conversation with a representative to fully explain the implications. This lack of communication and transparency is deeply concerning. 

Furthermore, XXXX practices appear to lack adequate safeguards to prevent repeated and automatic deferments amd forbarance. These forbearances caused my loan balance, which initially was manageable, to grow substantially over time. This outcome has placed an undue financial burden on me, as I was not made fully aware of how these deferments would affect the overall loan balance and XXXX would auto place me on a forbearance. 

Navient 's actions seem to exploit borrowers who XXXX not fully understand the long-term consequences of deferments. I firmly believe there should have been stronger checks and balances in place to prevent this situation, such as freezing the account or requiring direct consultation with a borrower before applying consecutive deferments. 

I respectfully request that your agency investigate XXXX practices regarding deferments to ensure that other borrowers are not subjected to similar predatory practices. Additionally, I would appreciate guidance on any available recourse for the financial harm I have experienced.

XXXX, MD XXXX XXXX/XXXX/1025 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX Subject : Complaint Regarding Inaccurate Credit Reporting Following Loan Forgiveness Dear CFPB Representative, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding inaccurate information on my credit reports maintained by XXXX, XXXX, and TransUnion. Despite providing all three credit bureaus with documentation that my loans were forgiven, this information has not been accurately reflected on my credit reports, negatively impacting my credit score. 

I have contacted the credit bureaus directly, submitted a dispute with supporting documentation, and allowed the legally required 30-day period for an investigation and correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). However, my reports still show the incorrect loan status, which is not only inaccurate but also a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. 

The inaccurate reporting is causing significant harm to my financial well-being, including but not limited to : Lowering my credit score. 
Hindering my access to fair credit opportunities. 
Causing undue stress and financial instability. 

I am requesting the CFPB to intervene and assist in ensuring that my credit reports are promptly updated to reflect the correct informationspecifically, that the forgiven loans show a {$0.00} balance or are removed as appropriate. I am also seeking confirmation of the corrective actions taken by the credit bureaus and the creditors involved. 

Enclosed are copies of : The loan forgiveness documentation. 
Correspondence with the credit bureaus. 
Dispute submissions and responses received ( if any ). 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution to correct my credit reports and protect my consumer rights.

01/18/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I have tried on two separate occasions to correct an issue with the deferment of my loans. I am in the middle of my 4 year program and should have "" In School '' deferment until I graduate with an addition 6 month grace period after that. As of right now, each loan has a vastly different deferment end date, loan repayment start date and loan end date. 

I first called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  MT, and after navigating the the automated answering service I selected to receive a call back. I was told that it would take roughly 2 hours for me to receive a call back. They ended up calling me back at XXXX XXXX  MT, the phone rang exactly one time and the call was immediately terminated at the end of that ring. I ended up calling back at XXXX XXXX MT to get back in the cue to speak to an agent. I once again selected to receive a call back, this time I was told that the wait would be over 2 hours. I finally received a call back at XXXX XXXX  MT, I explained my situation to the agent, they agreed that the issue was on their end and that the "" In School '' deferment dates should line up for each of my loans. I was then told that this situation couldn't be solved by them and that my call would need to be directed to a Supervisor of some kind. I was once again put on hold and I remained on hold until well after XXXX XXXX  MT ( XXXX XXXX  CT ) which is when they close their office. So I was on hold for 5 and 1/2 hours that day only to be ignored until they closed. 

My second attempt at rectifying this situation was on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  MT. I once again navigated the automated answering service and was told that I would receive a call back in about 1 and 1/2 hours. I received a call back at XXXX XXXX MT explained my case to another Agent who once again agreed that the "" In School '' deferment dates should all align and that a Supervisor would be need to solve my problem. I was told that I would need to be on hold for another 4 hours. Midway through the hold I was informed that an error occurred and that my call would need to be restarted. 2 Hours after that I was once again speaking with a new agent that was unable to solve my problem. They placed me on yet another hold to wait for a Supervisor to become available. At about XXXX XXXX  MT I was once again informed that an error occurred and that I would need to restart my call again. 

I elected to not call back again today because I knew that the MOHELA office was to close in another 30 minutes, not giving me enough time to solve the issue. All said and done I was on hold/waiting for a return call for 8 hours. This is completely unacceptable, especially when considering that I am calling to have a mistake that MOHELA made corrected. I do not know how a business can conduct itself in such a manner when the work they're dealing in can drastically effect the financial wellbeing of their clients. 

I have sent a direct message to MOHELA, and emailed their Director of Business Development & Government Relations, Federal Contract and Program Senior Manager and their CEO and have yet to hear back as of typing this complaint.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,ID,83706,None,Consent provided,Web,01/18/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11653267

NOTE : If my student loans, or any other student loans are listed as XXXX XXXX student loans then the qualification of separatly both will be different toward the IDR forgiveness. [ e.g. Graduate student loans and XXXX student loans have different eligibility ]. This is why such HORRIFIC mistake is sinfully made into the student payment count : to disqualify qualified payments under XXXX DIRECT CONSOLIDATED LOAN! 
XXXX. More importantly, such division placed my student loans ' payment count under the 25 years of forgiveness, instead of 20 years per the XXXX Department of Education promises : they will credit the payments according to my SAVE plan, but they PURPOSELY SWITCHED MY PAYE PLAN SO StudentAid.gov INCREASES MY REPAYMENT PERIOD to the 25 YEARS period in repayment, UNDER SAVE PLAN AND payments ' months are CALCULATED WRONGLY UNDER THE GRADUATE REPAYMENTS ( XXXX  YEARS VS. XXXX FOR XXXX ). 

THIS IS TOTALY MESSED UP, SO WRONG ... .SO INCORRECT, SO SCAMMING .... 

PLEASE SEE THE SCAMM AS COPIED FROM MY ACCOUNT : XXXX Qualifying Payments XXXX Remaining Payments Loan Type Qualifying Payment ( XXXX ) Estimated XXXX End of Repayment Term XXXX - Direct Consolidated Unsubsidized - {$43000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX I NEVER WANTED TO BE ON THE SAVE PLAN!!!

I talk to XXXX and after explaining to her what is going on she tells me she needs to transfer me to one of their advanced workers and then I am given the message it will be a hold of 5 hr and 25 minutes and the process stated all over again.

However, and once again without notice, Mohela reversed this payment, backdating the transaction to XX/XX/XXXX despite having displayed the payment as accepted as late as XX/XX/XXXX. I sent the following message to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX, when I logged in once again to confirm that Mohela hadn't created an issue with this payment. Mohela has not responded.

01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In light of the numerous attempts to enroll in an income based repayment program for which I have submitted numerous times. Shouldnt my loans have been placed in either processing or administrative forbearance the last few months? At one point a representatitve from mohela said that they hadnt received any income based repayment applications. However, I have submitted this a number of times dating back to with my consolidation loans in XX/XX/year> at this point I have most recently submitted a PAYE application which has been acknowledged as received. 

Previously, I have submitted IBR application ( s ) as well as others however my consolidation loans have never been enrolled in a repayment plan other than the highest payment amount of standard repayment plan. They are citing litigation over SAVE program however this has nothing to do with IBR applications and now that PAYE is re-opened it was claimed that they hadn't received any of my applications?! 

One application I submitted via mail which they also said was never received however it was signed for and marked as delivered. At one point they acknowledged that they had received my applications- AND THEN deleted the forms that I uploaded to their website under documents submitted to us and then said they had not received any applications for income based repayment. It's not possible to even apply for consolidation loans without selecting an income based repayment application and submitting it. 

When contacting Mohlea they place my loans keep being palced in a "" voluntary forbearance '' which I never consented or asked for instead of the correct "" processing '' or "" administrative '' forbearance so that interest continues to accrue on my account I believe for the sole purpose of attempting to generate more money. 


Previously I contacted them with the following but did not receive a reply "" I understand it may take some additional time to process however this inquiry and communication is to ask why I have been in a voluntary forbearance instead of administrative or processing seeing as I have applied a number of times over the last few months. If you could, please adjust my record of forbearance to reflect the corresponding administrative and processing forbearance that wanting to pay on my loans under an IDR and having applied which implies a pending processing of them litigation or not, that would be ideal.

I hereby give your Company notice pursuant to 15 USC 1602 ( k ) that your Company never provided an adequate notice which clearly & conspicuously mentions the pertinent facts of this transaction. Your Company didn't even inform about the Cost of Credit and the only evidence of the indebtedness was just a computer-generated agreement. According to 15 USC 1602 ( k ), the term "" adequate notice '' means a printed notice to a cardholder which sets forth the pertinent facts clearly and conspicuously so that a person against whom it is to operate could reasonably be expected to have noticed it and understood its meaning. Such notice may be given to a cardholder by printing the notice on any credit card, or on each periodic statement of account, issued to the cardholder, or by any other means reasonably assuring the receipt thereof by the cardholder. Since adequate notice was not given as per the above- mentioned section, I couldn't understand its meaning which is a violation under 15 USC 1602 ( k ). Further, pursuant to 15 USC 1601 ( a ) a consumer must be aware of the cost of transaction. Since I was not aware of the transaction therefore made an uninformed decision and it resulted in multiple billing errors and unfair credit card practices. From your end, I have not benefited from this transaction which is again a violation of 15 USC 1602 ( p ). According to 15 USC 1602 ( p ), the term "" unauthorized use '' means a use of a credit card by a person other than the cardholder who does not have actual, implied, or apparent authority for such use and from which the cardholder receives no benefit.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security.

I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ).

2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information.

3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions :",None,Servicer under contract with Federal Student Aid,NY,11553,None,Consent provided,Web,02/10/25,Untimely response,No,N/A,12005350

My personal and financial information, as well as that of my family, was compromised without my authorization, which is a clear violation of FERPA and your institutions responsibility to protect the confidentiality of my records. 

As you are aware, FERPA safeguards the privacy of student records, including personal and financial information. The breach of my data is not only a direct violation of FERPA but also renders any agreements related to my student loans null and void, as it compromises the very contract under which my loans were issued. The unauthorized release of my personal and financial details has caused significant harm, and I believe this breach warrants at minimum, the full discharge of my student loan debt. 

Not only was my own information released without my consent, but also my familys financial information, which was provided during the loan application process.

Additionally, I am entitled to information regarding my loan balance, repayment options, interest rates, and any fees associated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as access to my payment history and information about any potential deferment or forbearance options. Furthermore, I am entitled to all documents with my signature on them that I signed XXXX XXXX XXXX, which you are currently withholding from me. Please note that an XXXX spreadsheet does not constitute the conditions of a contract. 

The more I request and receive the same information from all entities, it seems that each one of you adds or modifies details in the documents you send. There are discrepancies compared to the original one I received in XXXX from XXXX. Everyone has conveniently added more information into the XXXX, and I do have the original encrypted message from XXXX that clearly shows this information wasn't there before. This is just a generic document, which is, number XXXX, not legible. According to contract law, the form must be legible. 

Moreover, the shutdown of Conduent due to poor loan servicing practices and my unsuccessful attempts to obtain documentation over the past five years only exacerbate my concerns regarding the validity of my loan. My records show no evidence of payments made from XXXX to XXXX, despite having utilized forbearances and deferments. 
To whom it may concern, I am writing to formally request the original documentation related to my loan, including all signed loan documents. It is imperative to note that I am not interested in a generic Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) or loan amount ; rather, I require the specific documents that bear my original signature. 

It has come to my attention that the documents you have previously provided do not reflect my consent and obligations accurately. Furthermore, despite my repeated requests, I have yet to receive a copy of the signature that appears on these forms. 

As per Colorado contract law, specifically referencing the statute signed by the Governor of Colorado, you are obligated to provide these materials within five days of my request. It is concerning that, as a financial institution tasked with the responsible handling of monetary transactions, you are unable to present the necessary documentation that underpins this loan agreement.

Specifically, XXXX XXXX  misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

02/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"This letter is a statement of dissatisfaction with the XXXX XXXX XXXX servicing company MOHELA. My son was the recipient of and unneeded loan as a result of the XXXX process. He inadvertently signed up for a non-subsidized loan to cover college tuition expenses that he did want or need as XXXX moneys cover he tuition costs making a loan unnecessary. As a result he was rewarded a refund at the end of his first term by XXXX XXXX XXXX thus notifying us of the loan 's existence. 

We attempted to use MOHELA 's website to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXX to so we would not accrue any interest against the balance owing. The payment never posted to my son 's account and at the end of the second term we discovered the initial disbursement showed unpaid and that {$XXXX} of interest had accrued. There was also a discrepancy in the Principal amount of the loan disbursed compared to the amount XXXX XXXX XXXX reported receiving. The difference of {$XXXX} for each disbursement had no explanation attached to it. I have since learned that the {$XXXX} was a loan service fee but no where on my son 's account was that indicated and I had to learn that by scouring the XXXX XXXX XXXX website. 

In XX/XX/XXXX we again used the MOHELA 's website to pay off the principal balance to include the {$XXXX} of interest that had accrued since the first disbursement in XX/XX/XXXX, which we had tried to avoid by attempting to make the payment in XXXX. The payment transaction posted to our bank account on XX/XX/XXXX but after a week we did not see any indication that MOHELA had received the payment and interest was still accruing on the new principal balance that should be {$XXXX}. We then tried to contact MOHELA via both email and telephone to inquire about the difference in the outstanding principal balance versus amount of money disbursed to XXXX XXXX XXXX and about the lack of documentation on whether or not the payment had posted to my son 's account. The initial email contact was submitted and received through MOHELA 's web portal and did not answer any of our questions posed to them about the loan status but appeared to be a XXXX response indicating that they are only a loan servicer and to contact the school FA department if there are issues with the loan. We responded again through the web portal advising our plan to not pay the amount in question ( {$XXXX} for each disbursement ) until an explanation could be provided. I left our phone number for them to call ... ... no response was received. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we were on hold with MOHELA customer service for XXXX hours without speaking to a company representative. On XX/XX/XXXX, we were on hold for XXXX hours prior to speaking to a customer service representative that answered XXXX of my questions, regarding the difference in the outstanding principal compared to money disbursed, but could not answer additional questions as to why my payment had not posted to our son 's account after XXXX  days of the money being withdrawn from our bank account and how to stop further disbursements. I was put back on hold and waited and additional XXXX hours on hold so speak to an Advanced Customer Service Agent but was unceremoniously hung up on at XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) without any notification. They simply closed for the day and did not acknowledge that I had been on hold all day. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX we again attempted to speak to MOHELA customer service via phone. After XXXX hours we spoke to a customer service representative and again were told we needed to speak to an Advance Customer Service XXXX and were put on hold. This time we chose to receive a call from MOHELA customer Service by providing them our phone number within their automated phone tree. The recording indicated that MOHELA would return the phone call in their order they received it. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and we have not received a call from MOHELA and thus the reason for this letter. 

MOHELA is supposed to be servicing loans through the federal government financial aid system and all they appear to be doing is making sure they make as much money off of a students as they can by nickel and diming their customers. The lack of response to any of our inquiries made to MOHELA clearly show that they are not a customer service based entity. Students deserve better as they try to navigate a confusing collegiate experience only to be compounded by uncertainty and exploitation at the hands of a financial institution that his supposedly there to help and service the student. 

Our experience with MOHELA has been awful and ours is a very simple loan of only XXXX disbursements that we did not even want or need. I could not image being student with financial hardship and having to try and get information from MOHELA that XXXX be vital to their financial advancement/well being only to get nothing in response when they need the information. MOHELA is not a loan servicer worthy of being associated with the XXXX student aid programs. 

I will be sending a MOHELA a check for the {$XXXX} outstanding but will not be responsible for any additional interested accrued on the already paid balance that MOHELA may try to add on to my son 's account. We have canceled the scheduled third disbursement to XXXX XXXX XXXX via the school 's XXXX XXXX department. This should have been easily available through MOHELA themselves. MOHELA 's lack of response to their customers is deplorable.

01/25/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","My name is XXXX XXXX and my daughter, XXXX XXXX, attended XXXX XXXX from XXXX - XXXX. Our XXXX  application/case is against XXXX XXXX XXXX My case # is XXXX. I have filed at least XXXX complaints, contacted the ombudsman 3 times ( received incorrect, poor information - I know the laws better than them ), left 5 messages for the caseworker & was assured a response, yet never received XXXX. I would like my complaint to go to the Office of Federal Student Aid AND the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Complaint to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  FSA Ombudsman Group XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KY XXXX and to : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Federal Student Aid XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, KY XXXX Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Inequitable Processing of Borrower Defense Applications Dear Federal Student Aid Team, I am writing to express my concerns regarding the inequitable handling of Borrower Defense to Repayment applications. My individual Borrower Defense application, submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, has been pending for an extended period without resolution. My application reference number is XXXX. 

I understand that the Department of Education has up to three years to process applications under current regulations. However, I am deeply concerned about the apparent disparity between the timeframes for adjudicating class action Borrower Defense applications versus individual applications like mine. Publicly available information suggests that class action cases are being resolved in significantly less time, while individual borrowers are left waiting without transparency or communication regarding timelines. 

This discrepancy raises questions about the prioritization of cases and whether individual applicants are being treated fairly under the Departments principles of equity and accountability. It is also unclear why resources are being directed disproportionately toward resolving group claims while leaving individual borrowers in prolonged uncertainty. 

The delay in processing my application has caused significant hardship, including : - Accrual of over {$20000.00} in interest when interest is not supposed to accrue after 6 months from applying for XXXX and during in school deferment - Emotional stress stemming from absolute fear of crushing debt - Fear for XXXX XXXX because the illegal actions and abuse against her by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  I have implored, over and over, that someone read through her Borrower 's Defense case to see how overwhelming the proof of abuse and illegal actions by XXXX are - to the point of one top director of the whole of Student Affairs was FIRED by XXXX for 'hostile work environment ' - the same director who XXXX XXXXXXXX and denied her all rights for 4 years at this college- the disparity in processing timelines causing the loss of discharge due to new administration impact. That disparity and lack of equity and accountability would pile debt and hardship on my daughter who received NO education and was DENIED her rights to due process and her human rights and, instead, abused by administration of XXXX I respectfully request clarification on the following points : Why class action XXXX XXXX applications are being resolved more quickly than individual applications. 
What measures the Department is taking to ensure fair and equitable processing of all applications, regardless of case type. 
The current status of my individual application and how to achieve equity in adjudicating it now. 

I kindly urge the Department to address this inequity and provide greater transparency about how resources are allocated between class action and individual cases. This will help rebuild trust with borrowers and ensure fairness in the process. In ensuring this fairness and equity, it's evident that our individual application must be completed now, to demonstrate fairness and lack of discriminatory practice. 

I look forward to receiving a response upon receipt of this letter. Please feel free to contact me at : XXXX, or XXXX, to show the Department 's commitment to ensuring all borrowers their equitable rights. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Since XXXX  recently, I have been unable to secure stable employment and am experiencing significant financial hardship. Despite reaching out to my loan servicer to request assistance through forbearance or income-driven repayment options, I have encountered obstacles that are causing me distress. The lack of clear guidance and responsive customer service has made it difficult to navigate my options effectively, leaving me at risk of financial instability. 

My primary concerns include the servicers failure to provide timely and accurate information about available relief programs, including forbearance and income-driven repayment plans. Additionally, I have been subjected to confusing communication regarding interest accrual during forbearance periods and unclear timelines for application processing.

Many of us attended the following institutions owned by or affiliated with XXXX, where misrepresentations and predatory practices have been well-documented : * XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of Education has already found significant evidence of misconduct by these schools. Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding

Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Both wife and I have been educators in public schools for the past 30 years. 

We are now retired with our student loans ballooning due to accrued and capitalized interest to over {$150.00}, XXXX. This is unjust especially since we are not eligible for PSLF due to our loan type XXXX. The loans should have been separated two years ago when the XXXX law was passed in XXXX. 

My complaint is that the law to separate these loans passed in XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, nothing has been done to separate these loans. In addition, we continue to be ineligible for PSLF due to our loan type and the seemingly deliberate delay in the Department of Education in separating our loan to transfer to direct loans so we can qualify for PSLF. 

Because of this delay, we continue to experience hardship on a teacher retirement income with several illnesses. We can not afford to pay the loans. We should have been able to separate and receive PSLF, except for the Dept. Ed. deliberate delay in completing the process. 

It is unlawful that the process and the law have not been followed. The Department of Education delay has caused severe emotional, physical and financial hardship. It is unjust and unlawful. 

We need to know when the process for separation will be completed and if our PSLF will be implemented.

01/16/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Mohela titled "" Interest Accrual During Forbearance '' in which they told me that interest accrues on my account and I have the option to pay interest. The year prior, I had paid my student loans via auto debit from my bank account. So, in a panic, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX to try to offset interest. My payment never showed up on my account, so I called Mohela, and they had no trace of the payment. They told me I used the wrong account number since apparently everyone got new account numbers over the summer ( since the last time my payment was auto paid from my bank with my old account number ). They also told me that letter was sent to everyone by mistake. 

With my new account number, I contacted my bank in person to try to cancel or redirect the payment. They can not do anything -- so I contacted Mohela for a refund. After being on hold for XXXX and a half hours, I spoke to an "" advanced agent '' who said she was looking into the matter and asked me to wait on a brief hold *seven* times. After she put me on hold for the XXXX time, they hung up on me. I called back and the estimated wait was XXXX hours and XXXX minutes. Instead, I called the bill pay customer support through my bank, and they are opening a research ticket on my behalf. I am hopeful they will be able to resolve the issue. 

However, I urge the CFPB to investigate MOHELA on a nationwide level of scamming student loan borrows -- - from deflecting phone calls, sending out letters of disinformation, to disappearing payments without a trace. I am not the only XXXX in this boat.

Due to serious legal violations and breaches of the federal privacy laws, including the FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT ( FERPA ), the PRIVACY ACT OF 1974, and the HIGHER EDUCATION ACT, I demand the immediate cancellation of all financial obligations related to these debts.

It has come to my attention that my personal educational and financial information has been improperly accessed by unauthorized third parties, including Elon Musk or affiliated entities. This unauthorized access constitutes gross violation of my federal privacy rights and nullifies any enforceable loan agreements under federal law.

LEGAL GROUNDS FOR DISCHARGE : 1. FERPA VIOLATION : The exposure of my educational records without my express written consent is a direct breach of FERPA, which mandates the protection of personally identifiable information.

2. VIOLATION OF THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 : The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of my personal information contravenes federal requirements that safeguard the privacy of individuals data managed by federal agencies and contractors.

3. BREACH OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT : The Higher Education Act requires servicers to maintain strict confidentiality and compliance in loan transfers. The transfer of my loan to Aidvantage and subsequent data breaches demonstrate clear negligence.

4. BREACH OF CONTRACT AND DATA SECURITY OBLIGATIONS : By failing to protect my sensitive information, both MOHELA and Aidvantage have breached contractual terms and obligations, rendering these debts unenforceable.

DEMAND FOR RESOLUTION : Due to these violations, I formally demand : Immediate and unconditional cancellation of all financial obligations associated with my student loans.

Complete removal of all Aidvantage-related entries from my credit report.

Written confirmation of this cancellation and credit correction within 30 days.

If my demands are not met, I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including claims for damages arising from these privacy breaches and violations of federal law.

To date, they are operating the account without authorization or permission from the debtor BY THE LENDER. The lender has changed the status on the account multiple times without the debtors signature or request. 

These actions are fraudulent because the debt was discharged from NELNET via the IRS 1099-C Copy B form that was sent to the debtor. Instead of the account being properly closed, the account balance and status was improperly changed. The discharge of debt copy B form NELNET was sent via the mailing system and should be fully upheld.

02/04/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"Good day, I am writing to request urgent assistance with an ongoing issue involving my federal student loan servicer, Mohela. Despite my repeated attempts to resolve this matter, Mohela has failed to take action, and it is now jeopardizing my ability to purchase a home and achieve financial stability for my family. 

Here are the key details of my situation : Forbearance Issue : My federal student loans have been in forbearance for several months. I have contacted Mohela multiple times via phone, email, and written correspondence to request that my loans be removed from forbearance so I can resume making payments. However, Mohela has not taken any action, and my loans remain in forbearance.

Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) : I am a public servant with now more than XXXX qualifying payments toward PSLF. I am on the verge of having my remaining loan balance forgiven, but Mohelas inaction is delaying this process.

Home Purchase : I am currently under contract to purchase my first home, a critical step toward providing stability for my two children, both of whom have special medical needs. Unfortunately, Mohelas refusal to remove my loans from forbearance is preventing me from finalizing this purchase.

Financial Impact : I am willing and able to make payments ( as low as {$1.00} per month under an income-driven plan ), but Mohelas failure to act is causing significant stress and instability for my family during an already challenging time.

As a public servant, I dedicate my time to educating others on food stability and community well-being. Yet, the very system that was supposed to help me achieve the XXXX  dream is now holding me back. With the rising cost of housing and the uncertainty in our economy, this delay is not just frustrating ; it is devastating.

I am humbly requesting the CFPBs assistance in resolving this matter with Mohela. Specifically, I ask for help in : Ensuring my loans are removed from forbearance immediately.

Expediting the certification of my PSLF payments so I can achieve loan forgiveness.

Holding Mohela accountable for their lack of responsiveness and action for not just myself but others in my same situation. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me at XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX if you need additional information or documentation. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue so I can continue working toward a stable and secure future for my family and keep working hard to help others.

I told them my loans aren't set to come out of deferment until XXXX so it doesn't make sense for me to agree to pay up to {$170.00} per month while I'm unemployed when I'm currently required to pay {$0.00} per month.

Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 
At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions. 
2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 
We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

01/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am writing to formally express my concerns regarding the processing of my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan request and the handling of my federal student loans by FSA.gov. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request for an IDR plan through FSA.gov, which was directed to my then-loan servicer, XXXX. However, this request has remained in review with no action taken. Despite making monthly payments of {$190.00} for the past year, I had assumed these payments were in line with an IDR plan, when, in fact, I had been on a standard repayment plan. When I contacted MOHELA regarding my concerns, I was informed that because my loan servicer had changed, I was required to submit a new IDR request. I find it troubling that this responsibility was placed on me, the borrower, rather than being managed by the loan servicer or communicated through Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) notifications. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a new request for an IDR plan due to a change in my financial circumstances. My husband, who is XXXX XXXX in the XXXX, was stationed in XXXX for the next three years, and I had to relocate with him. As a result, I lost my job on XX/XX/XXXX. After speaking with a customer service representative, I was advised that my loans could be placed in deferment while my IDR request is reviewed. However, I was informed that this process could take up to a year for review, which seems excessive, especially given my current financial hardship. Since XX/XX/XXXX, my income has been {$0.00}. Today, I received an email stating that I am required to begin making standard payments next month. This is both concerning and overwhelming, given my current circumstances and the extended delays in processing my request. I am respectfully requesting immediate attention to my situation, including the approval of my IDR request and a deferral of any required payments until my application is reviewed and finalized.

02/12/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Improper use of your report,Reporting company used your report improperly,"I am writing to file a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding a serious violation of my personal and financial privacy rights. I have recently discovered that XXXX XXXX, or individuals associated with him, have gained unauthorized access to my sensitive personal and financial information, including my Social Security number. This access occurred both through my educational records and the Social Security Administration ( SSA ), without my knowledge or consent. 

The unauthorized disclosure and potential misuse of my financial information, including my Social Security number, is deeply concerning. I have not authorized any individual or entity to access or use my financial data, and I have not provided consent for XXXX XXXX or any associated parties to gain access to my information. 

The access of my personal data, including financial records and my Social Security number, appears to be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), which protects consumers from unauthorized access to their financial information. Additionally, any misuse of my Social Security number could expose me to identity theft and other financial harm, which the CFPB actively works to prevent and protect consumers from. 

I request the CFPB to : Investigate how XXXX XXXX and his associates were able to gain unauthorized access to my financial data and personal information through both educational institutions and the Social Security Administration.

Take the necessary steps to hold the responsible parties accountable for violating consumer privacy laws and ensure this type of data breach does not continue. 
Provide me with guidance on how I can take additional steps to protect myself from any potential misuse of my personal and financial information, particularly my Social Security number. 
This situation is distressing, and I trust the CFPB will investigate these serious violations of my rights under the applicable consumer protection laws. 

Please contact me at your earliest convenience to confirm receipt of my complaint and inform me of the next steps in the process.

Nevertheless, I submitted another IDR application to the SAVE program this morning in which I included both my employer letter and my W2. 

I then called MOHELA 's representatives to ask that I be placed back into the special administrative processing forbearance for SAVE.

Once I described my problem, the representative transferred me, at which point MOHELA 's automated system told me that the wait time would be nearly four hours. 

I then used the callback option. No one called me back. 

Now that I have been kicked out of the SAVE processing forbearance, loans worth over {$2000.00} are due in two days.

01/15/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My federal Direct student loans are currently on the SAVE payment plan. I electronically submitted an IDR Application to switch to IBR using the studentaid.gov application tool linked in Mohela 's FAQs webpage. On XX/XX/XXXX, Mohela uploaded a letter to my online account stating they could not grant my application because it was missing my signature. I reviewed the PDF of my application on my studentaid.gov account, and my name was typed in the signature field like all my previously submitted and approved electronic applications. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the Mohela customer service tool-free number to inquiry about the denial. During the conversation, the Mohela representative informed me that Mohela stopped accepting electronic signatures in XX/XX/XXXX, so all IDR applications require physical signatures. I explained I had submitted my application through the online portal and had not been informed the application required a physical signature. I also asked how they could not accept a form submitted through an online tool Mohela directs borrowers to use. The representative repeated that Mohela does not accept electronic signatures. Further attempts to reason with the representative were unproductive. 

Additionally, when I asked that my loans be placed on a PSLF-qualifying processing forbearance for the 60 days following my submission of my IDR application in XXXX, the representative informed me that the general forbearance on my loans could not be changed to a processing forbearance because I did not have a currently pending IDR application. I pointed out Mohela had been processing my IDR application from XX/XX/XXXX, until they denied it on XX/XX/XXXX, so I should have been placed on a processing forbearance during that time. After placing me on hold to speak with her supervisor ( named either XXXX or XXXX XXXX, the representative returned to our call and told me that she was submitting a request to the team that handles forbearances to ask that my loans be switched to a processing forbearance for the 60 days following my application 's submission in XXXX. She further informed me that this request would take 5-10 days to process. 

All of this is compounded by the fact that my remaining direct loans have 119 PSLF-qualifying months, meaning I only need one more qualifying month to trigger forgiveness. In addition to the issue described above, I told by Mohela on a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX, that the forbearance placed on my loans for that month would qualify for PSLF when I called to request the forbearance be removed from my loans in order for me to make my final payment. I was told not to worry and submit an ECF at the end of XXXX. I did so only to find that XXXX designated XXXX as well as XX/XX/XXXX as ineligible, even though I had made a payment in XXXX. I submitted a reconsideration request for both months, and eventually XX/XX/XXXX was marked eligible and qualifying, though XX/XX/XXXX remains ineligible. 

Mohela 's failure to accept IDR application forms submitted to through an online portal their own website instructs borrowers to go to is an unfair business practice at minimum and could be seen as deliberately delaying and/or preventing forgiveness for borrowers entitled to PSLF. Mohela 's actions, whether by incompetence, negligence, or malice, have repeated denied me the ability to fulfill my obligations under PSLF and prevented the discharge of my loans.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IA,52403,None,Consent provided,Web,01/15/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11547859

I later learned however that the request was canceled ( unbeknownst to me ) when the MOHELA system transitioned to another platform in the summer of 2024. Since then, I again requested the refund which has still not been processed. I have contacted MOHELA via phone on multiple occasions with the bulk of the time being spent on hold ( at least 10 hours in total ) and was told that the money is stuck with the Department of Treasury without any signs of progress and certainly no steps toward resolution or end date in sight.

Most recently, we escalated this at least twice to a manager who attempts to escalate our case even further, again without any indication of when progress will be made, nor any way to inquire about updates.

2. What action do I need to take and who do I take it with?

3. If my borrower defense case for XXXX is eventually approved, but that balance has been discharged under the XXXX forgiveness, will I still receive a retro-active refund of money that I paid on those loans, including the refund payments that were applied to them?

I've called every month or two for about a year since each time I'm told I'm on forbearance, I keep somehow getting switched off of it as if I'm not enrolled in SAVE. None of my peers have had to deal with this. I don't have good dates for those calls since it's been over a year, but I assume the agency has record of all calls made regarding my account. The below dates are the dates of the most recent sequence of events. 

XX/XX/XXXX : First time I received a document for my forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Document informing me that I was in collections for missed payments. Made multiple phone calls before finally getting a hold of someone at the end of the day who helped put me into forbearance ( supposedly ). I had pushed the callback button and never received a call back in the time frame given, so I had to initiate the final call where I got helped. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Document received informing me of forbearance, again. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Received notice that I had a payment due in XXXX. I was told I'd be in forbearance until the SAVE stuff worked out ; all other SAVE folks are on forbearance until XXXX, so there must have been an error. Called three times this day, was disconnected twice and once stayed on hold after work until their hours of operation closed. Pushed callback button. No callback. Filed complaint with federal aid requesting new servicer. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Attempted phone call, was on hold for twice as long as was told before hanging up ( after 3.5 hours ). Pushed call back button. No call back. Sent message to agency. No response.

When I spoke with someone about only needing one more qualifying payment since XX/XX/year> they told me to give my last application time to update. Everyone I speak to gives different information. Another person I spoke with said I was in forbearance and to call Mohela. Mohela has a 2 1/2 hour wait time to speak with someone. This is becoming very frustrating. When I look at the other program it says I have made I have 107 of 394 payments left which means there are 287 qualifying payments ; however PSLF says I have made the 119 payments of 120 needed for discharge. If I have made over 120, this is incorrect and should be forgiven. Everything is all over the place. Then it has different amounts for all platforms.

The check was mailed by employer, the U.S. government, to the correct address for such payments at the time ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX ). However, MOHELA has failed to apply those funds to my account. I first called MOHELA about this issue on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a representative who said that they had identified the payment and that it would be applied to my account within a couple weeks. Several calls and several months later, I learned that nobody at MOHELA had submitted a proper research request to have the payment applied. On XX/XX/XXXX, I confirmed that they had opened research request # XXXX. Still, however, the payment has not been applied. In the meantime, I continued making my regular monthly loan payments, and in XX/XX/XXXX my loan account was paid off. This means that MOHELA NOW OWES ME MONEY. They need to apply the {$2600.00} check as of XX/XX/XXXX ; reconcile the loan account ; and refund me my money immediately. 

I previously submitted a complaint to the CFPB about the same issue ( complaint # XXXX ). MOHELA 's response was essentially "" we're working on it.

My student loans entered repayment with MOHELA in XXXX of XXXX. The government put all income driven repayment ( IDR ) on pause at that time.

I submitted my application for both an XXXX plan and XXXX in XXXX of XXXX when my loans entered repayment. I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and would qualify for XXXX. Since the government was not and is still not processing these applications, I have not paid the monthly amount due. The IDR monthly payment would be around {$100.00} where the MOHELA monthly payment is {$810.00}. The full monthly payment will not count towards the XXXX IDR payment required for PSLF. When talking to customer service, they told me there was nothing they could do to help me and put me in a general forbearance. After speaking to a different representative, they told me that I should have been put on a processing forbearance because I am waiting for the applications to be processed by the government. I have been on 60-day forbearances since then. The monthly payment is {$0.00}, but my interest has been building since XXXX of XXXX. People who already were on IDR and have PSFL, have not been building interest or been charged since the government has been on pause. I think it would be fair if I was no longer charged interest on my loans since I am on a processing forbearance. I should not have been charged interest since XXXX of XXXX. The customer service at MOHELA is also horrible. You can only contact them via phone. Once you call, they put you on hold for 40-90 minutes. Once you pass that hold, they put you on a second hold ( I waited 2 hours ) to get you to the second group of people who can actually change things in your account. I was told that this is the only way to manage your account. I have to call every 60 days to ask for another processing forbearance taking up 3-4 hours of time.

02/11/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the unauthorized access and breach of my educational records, financial aid data, and IRS tax information by the U.S. Department of Education ( DOE ) and the Department of Governmental Entities ( DOGE ). This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security.

I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ).

2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information.

Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

4. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach. This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties. I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your immediate response and resolution.

Recently, I became aware that access to the U.S. Department of Educations ( DOE ) system was restricted due to actions allegedly taken by Elon Musk or an entity under his control. As a result, I have been unable to retrieve essential information related to my student loans, which has directly caused delays in processing my income-driven repayment application. Due to this delay, I have accrued additional interest on my loans, increasing my overall debt burden through no fault of my own. I respectfully request the following actions : Immediate restoration of access to my student loan information.

Financial relief in the form of reimbursement or cancellation of the accrued interest caused by the delay in my IDR application processing.

Reversal of any late fees or penalties that may have resulted from the restricted access.

Investigation into the cause of the restricted access and whether this violates my rights under FERPA, federal loan servicing agreements, or other relevant regulations.

Assurance that future access to my loan records will not be unlawfully obstructed. 

Please confirm receipt of this complaint and provide guidance on the next steps. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and request a formal response outlining how you will address this issue.

All of my loans are currently covered under the SAVE repayment plan.

According to Mohela, I owed {$890.00} in interest that had accrued over the past several months. I immediately issued specified payments on each of my loans to resolve the outstanding interest.

Thereafter, I consulted with a financial advisor/attorney, who advised me that Mohela had improperly claimed interest existed, when it in fact, did not.

Mohela appears to have allocated the funds to each of my principal balances respectively, however, Mohela also continues to report the funds paid were specifically applied to "" interest ''.

As Mohela has done nothing but lie and misrepresent issues surrounding my ( and millions of other ) student loans, I am contacting the CFPB to report this event, and to otherwise request clarity as to whether funds paid to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX should or should not be present/accounted for on my annual taxes, specifically the 1098-e form.

I have made several attempts over the past months to speak with Mohela to get clarity on this matter, but despite countless hours spent and numerous attempts I am still without the required documentation. 

After finally being able to speak with a XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, we discussed my repayment plan, and I explicitly requested a memo confirming my repayment amount under the agreed plan. However, due to system issues, the XXXX had to manually calculate my repayment, which resulted in a completely different figure than the one provided by XXXX online simulator. I was informed that I would receive this document within XXXX to XXXX business days, and I have yet to receive any correspondence or documentation. I know now, with experience that they will never reach out to me as I have previously attempted to receive this document via email which they never replied to. 

This delay has directly impacted my ability to secure housing, as the document is a critical requirement for my housing approval process. Because of this, I have been denied housing for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I have been trying to resolve this issue since XXXX, even submitting my XXXX application multiple times. Each time, I was told it was under review for months, which has added even more frustration to an already difficult situation. Noting, my lease ends in XX/XX/XXXX and I have no idea what to do. 

This ongoing lack of communication and failure to deliver on promised timelines is unacceptable. I need this documentation as a matter of urgency to move forward with my housing application. 

I kindly request immediate intervention so I XXXX be contacted ASAP I can expect to receive the written documentation of my repayment plan. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will have no choice but to escalate my concerns further. I have attempted to seek help from XXXX but that attempt failed and was redirected to Mohela ( my loan servicer ).

02/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Ohio, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Student Loan Forgiveness Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally request complete forgiveness of my student loans due to significant violations of my privacy and federal law, particularly concerning the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) XXXX These violations have caused severe emotional distress and hardship, further exacerbated by the involvement of external parties who have accessed sensitive information related to my education without my consent. 

It has come to my attention that my private educational records were compromised due to an illegal disclosure or breach, specifically involving individuals or entities with no legitimate need to access this information. As you are aware, FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of student records, and any unauthorized access to these records is a clear violation of my rights under this law. 

Furthermore, I have reason to believe that XXXX XXXX or associated entities have gained unauthorized access to government records that include personal information about my educational background. The improper handling of such sensitive data has not only violated my privacy but has also undermined my ability to trust institutions that hold my personal and academic records. 

Given the severity of these violations, I believe it is both justified and necessary for my student loans to be forgiven as a means of addressing the harm and distress caused by these breaches of privacy. The violation of FERPA rights and the involvement of external actors, particularly those with substantial power and access to sensitive data, has placed an undue burden on me that I should not have to bear. 

I kindly ask that you review my case thoroughly and consider the extenuating circumstances surrounding this matter. I am happy to provide any additional documentation or information needed to support my request. I simply do not feel comfortable with the fact that my personal information has been compromised. This is the reason I believe all of my student loans should be forgiven. I also make below average in America.

01/31/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Problem with personal statement of dispute,"My loans are with Nelnet and have been for a few years. I have always been in good standing for 12 years to be exact due to the fact I qualify for the Income driven repayment plan ; that I recertify for every year. My next recertification was due in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX I received a notification of delinquent status for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX from my credit wise account and XXXX points was deducted from my XXXX XXXX from Sloan servicing. I immediately look them up and contact them to see what's going on, and dispute the XXXX deduction from my score. The representative advised that XXXX is the sister company of Nelnet and some of my loans were transferred with them including the Income driven repayment plan. The representative also stated that they will review the credit report dispute and have contacted me via email on several occasions and by mail. Also, an XXXX XXXX application is needed at this time to stop the ongoing delinquency. However, the only mail I got from XXXX is the recent credit report review that they denied. I did a search through my email for XXXX and nothing comes up. I only have email from Nelnet. If I did get anything I would have handled whatever was needed immediately because I like to be in good standing with my accounts and have always been. During my call with XXXX, I recertified online while on the phone with the representative and the representative said it was received. A representative at XXXX told me that my Income Driven Plan recertification app was approved. However, I have not received any communication/mail stating it was approved or not. I asked the representative, if my loans and Income driven repayment app was transferred over then why would I be put in delinquent status when it was not due for recertification until XX/XX/XXXX. The representative just kept repeating, we looked into it and the account has been delinquent since XX/XX/XXXX and there is nothing they can do. I work very hard to keep a positive credit record. I never received anything from them, not a call, an email or, mail but a credit dispute review denial letter. Additionally, If I was delinquent since XX/XX/XXXX I would have been in delinquent status way before XX/XX/XXXX as their website states Until an account reaches 90 days past due, it's reported as up to date. When an account reaches 90 days past due, it's reported as delinquent. 
I repeatedly advised them I am not receiving any communications from them and to please investigate the communications issue further, through my BBB dispute. As of today XX/XX/XXXX I still have not received any mail from them. They clearly are not trying to fix the communication issue that will cause me to go in delinquent status in the future. Sloan servicing put me in a payment status when I already had and IDR app filed for XXXX and have damaged my credit by putting me in delinquent. I found that they have put several borrowers back in repayment without properly notifying them causing them to be past due and/or delinquent. I still have not received any communication from them, even after completing another XXXX app XX/XX/XXXX. I do not know what else to do to resolve this communications issue because they clearly do not care.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",NV,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/31/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11879150

Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Ex

ecutive Summary and Statements of Facts. We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions
. 
XXXX. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

01/22/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I currently have {$170000.00} in student loan debt being serviced by Mohela. I work in a non-profit setting, and thus I am in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. I have applied for discharge / forgiveness because I am over the required 120 qualifying payments while working for a public service / non-profit employer. Mohela has my account currently in a "" general forbearance '' which means no payments are due at this time each month, but the months do not qualify for PSLF forgiveness.

However, I believe I should be in a "" processing forebearance '', which the Office of Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) states does qualify each month as a qualified month towards gaining forgiveness to 120 qualifying months.

I was in the Income Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan under the SAVE program, but on XX/XX/XXXX I submitted an application to switch my repayment plan to the Income Contingent Repayment ( ICR ) plan. To this day, my application still says it is being reviewed by Mohela and I am thus still on the SAVE repayment plan.

I received an email from FSA on XX/XX/XXXX updating me on SAVE. This is where I learned that my account should really be in a processing forbearance ( see email attachment ).

Per FSA guidelines, if the loan servicer ( Mohela ) has not processed a repayment application within 60 days, you are supposed to be placed in a "" Processing Forbearance ''.

Per FSA : If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for PSLF and IDR forgiveness. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. 

Thus, since I applied on XX/XX/XXXX, and my application is still not processed, my account should have been placed in a Processing Forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX. From this time forward, my months should be counted towards my PSLF forgiveness, which at this point puts me over 120 qualifying months, and my entire balance should be discharged per PSLF guidelines. 

I spoke to Mohela and requested this change to be made to my forbearance, but they said they could not do this. I explained the FSA guidelines and they still refused to process my request.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CA,92131,None,Consent provided,Web,01/22/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11694682

Specifically, XXXXXXXX XXXX misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 
At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 
We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 
We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

02/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Mohela implemented a new loan servicing system in XXXX, and it is clearly not functioning properly. On XX/XX/XXXX, their autopay system made an extra payment on my student loan, resulting in a negative balance of - {$190.00}. I was assured multiple times that this balance would be transferred to my other loan within XXXX  days, then later told it would take XXXX  days. However, despite over XXXX  days passing, Mohela has failed to process this simple correction. 

Because of their inaction, I have been unfairly charged interest for XXXX months based on an incorrect loan balance. I have reached out to Mohela multiple times, escalating my request, but they have ignored my most recent formal inquiry, sent over XXXX business days ago and several before that were also ignored. 

This is likely not just an isolated incident. XXXX refusal to address my issue, despite repeated assurances, suggests that their new system is failing on a larger scale, potentially affecting thousands of borrowers. Their lack of accountability and unwillingness to correct their own errors is financially harming borrowers and XXXX constitute widespread mismanagement.

01/04/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I was in the cohort of DoEd borrowers on PSLF who transitioned their PSLF servicing from MOHELA to FSA/studentaid.gov in the summer of XXXX, despite MOHELA servicing every other aspect of my loans. This transition placed me on an administrative forbearance.

To add to this confusion, during this transition the SAVE plan was also published and then subsequently challenged/frozen in court. All this resulted in me being placed on multiple forbearances, during which time conflicting information was shared by both FSA/DoEd as well as MOHELA as to whether or not these forbearance months would count as qualifying months towards my PSLF.

I've certified my employment as working for an eligible employer several times this year, the last being on XX/XX/XXXX, with FSA confirming my count is still at 115. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, at the instruction of FSA, I submitted a buyback request for the missing months, which is still in processing with no transparency.

I also submitted a request with MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX to change payment plans to get me off SAVE and into an IDR plan to continue making eligible payments in case my buyback request with FSA didn't pan out. That is also stuck in processing.

After multiple attempts at outreach to both MOHELA and FSA/DoEd, I've been stuck in administrative limbo making no
progress towards my count of 120 in PSLF. I have been sitting at 115/120 since XXXX of 2024 and am well past what should have been my required 120 months of qualifying employment and payment. I have kept my end of the proverbial bargain when it comes to time spent in public service, and in return I've been forgotten.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,PA,19104,None,Consent provided,Web,01/07/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11383060

As the Affiant in the TPD refund proceeding, I am seeking redress and the restitution of funds rightfully owed to me, funds which have been illicitly obtained by ECMC agents over a period of 12 years, thereby impeding the TPD refund process in contravention of the mandates set forth in the Human Trafficking Victims Protection Act, 22 U.S.C. 7102, specifically referencing Sections 1, 3, and 8, with a pointed emphasis on the provision pertaining to ABUSE OR THREATENED ABUSE OF LAW OR LEGAL PROCESS, which is defined as the XXXX of a legal statute or procedural mechanism, whether in an administrative, civil, or criminal context, for any end or purpose that is antithetical to the original intent of said statute or mechanism. 

XXXX. I am submitting this affidavit to bolster the implementation of the TPD refund policy and to advocate for the return of monies illicitly extracted from me by ECMC for a duration exceeding XXXX  years, as evidenced by the appended Exhibits XXXX and XXXX, along with the hyperlinked documentation indicating the legal advertisement for the TPD REFUND PROCESS. Additionally, in XX/XX/XXXX I wrote the below linked affidavit to XXXX by error, it belongs with the ECMC lawyers. Please read it carefully at : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

XXXX. This communication represents my fourth endeavor to reclaim my rightful, as advertised, TPD refund. 

XXXX. The intent of this affidavit is to facilitate the recovery of the aforementioned ECMC refund and to delineate the reasons behind ECMC legal counsel 's tacit complicity, through non-action, in perpetuating ECMC 's misuse of legal processes, as defined under 18 U.S.C. 4 Misprision of Felony.

5. ECMC has willfully engaged in the manipulation of the legal system to fabricate an illusion of lawful authority, a spurious judgment not grounded in judicial sanction, but rather a mere representation thereof, and lawlessly used such to seize money not owed. ECMC intentionally used the legal system to attain a delusion of law, a counterfeit, a treasonous statement of a judgment, not a judgment, but a statement of a judgment fraud. They lawlessly used such to seize over {$300.00} a month from my Social Security account, despite having medical documentation from a licensed doctor, of an induced TPD XXXX, which qualified Affiant for student loan discharge. Affiant was maliciously rebuffed.

6. Affiant, XXXX XXXX, was denied equal protection of the law. ECMC proceeded to garnish over {$300.00} a month from Affiants Social Security account with no affidavit and no validation. This lawless garnishment persisted from XXXX to XXXX. This caused and effectuated the financial strain of an over the decade inability to pay for needed health coverage, due to ECMCs lawless money seizures, in the midst of the Covid pandemic.

7. It is imperative that I am shielded from further exploitation through this ongoing fiscal predation. I implore that the XXXX funds nefariously siphoned from my acquired Social Security reserves be returned forthwith. It is pertinent to note that I have been further victimized by the criminal inability to access XXXX as a result of ECMC 's unlawful misappropriation of my Social Security finances, absent any affidavit, judicial decree, validation, or proof of claim, a practice that has persisted since XXXX. 

XXXX. I direct your attention to page XXXX of the linked affidavit below, which contains the TPD medical documentation, submitted in XXXX, evidencing medical qualification for TPD discharge, documentation that was flagrantly ignored. The pertinent page can be accessed via the following hyperlinks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Additionally, I invite review of the many legal disputes, demands for validation, and the lawsuit initiated against ECMC to halt the abuse of process, financial exploitation and wrongful deprivation of funds from my Social Security account. Despite the presentation of facts and evidence, my finances have been misappropriated for over 12 years. Please refer to the following documentation : XXXX ECMC LAWSUIT XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX FEDERAL ALLEGED JUDGE XXXX CRIMINAL USE OF THE FEDERAL BENCH FOR ECMC CASE SABOTAGE, CORRUPTION AND MALFEASANCE, SHE ORDERED MY SINGLE SIDED COMPLAINT, TO BE COPIED DOUBLE SIDED, TO CREATE A DEFECTIVE COMPLAINT, WHILE PLAINTIFF HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE DEFECT. THE CORRUPTION WAS NEVER ENDING, BUT XXXX! 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ECMC agents have deliberately manipulated the legal framework to craft a deceptive semblance of a legal judgment, absent an authenticated judicial seal, constituting a fraudulent abuse of process that has resulted in undue harm to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX. Through its actions, ECMC agents have egregiously perverted our legal system for over a decade to unlawfully divest Affiant of her finances, causing harm, injury, and distress. They have criminally employed the legal system for purposes never envisioned by the law. Affiant seeks an end to these obstructions of law and repeated use of laws for what they are not intended 12. The actions of ECMC agents in illicitly and inappropriately manipulating the legal system against the Affiant via the contrived illusion of a legal judgment, utilizing this fallacy, devoid of affidavit, notice, service, and with a falsified promissory note, to expropriate my finances for over a decade, demonstrate a pattern of conduct that now seeks to criminally distort the TPD refund process. This is another ECMC agent engaged in financial predation through the obstruction of the U.S. Department of Education 's outlined collection, TPD discharge and refund procedure. 

XXXX. The unauthorized and non-consensual payments procured by ECMC agents are obligated to be reimbursed in accordance with the stipulations of the TPD refund advertisement, which declares that refunds are warranted subsequent to the receipt of XXXX XXXX documentation. The evidence unequivocally illustrates that such SSA TPD documentation has been on record since XXXX. 

XXXX. The TPD refund is due because ECMC payments were lawlessly syphoned with no consent or authority after the XXXX date the physician certified Affiants discharge application 15. The persistent obstruction of the TPD refund process by ECMC agents is indicative of ulterior motives, employing a corrupted use of the legal system. XXXX, XXXX XXXX, has incurred over XXXX years of damages directly attributable to the ECMC agents ' malfeasance in the legal process, perpetrated in a multifaceted and criminal manner. I seek the cessation of these legal obstructions and the repeated misuse of laws for unintended purposes.

16. These ECMC agents criminal abuse of process acts, enforce income lynching and financial servitude, making human trafficking easy. Above all, the ECMCs agents ' repeated TPD refund denials exemplify abuse of process, conspiracy against rights, and use of laws and legal processes, in a manner in which the laws were not created. The ECMC agents are criminally using their ECMC education system to obstruct the XXXX XXXX Victims Protection Act, 22 U.S.C. 7102, Sections 1,3 and 8. This has to be stopped. 

In conclusion, I respectfully demand the restitution of the TPD refund monies illicitly divested from me. Kindly advise if further details are requisite. I attest that the information provided herein is accurate, correct, and rooted in personal experiences of ECM criminal abuse of process, which serve no legitimate societal function but rather facilitate the advancement of human trafficking as documented in the above-referenced and linked affidavits. I implore that the actions of ECMC agents be guided accordingly and that my finances be restored without delay. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated. I have attached XXXX exhibits and several references in support of the TPD refund entitlement. Please refund the money due me immediately. Thank you.

During my transition from REPAYE to SAVE on around XX/XX/XXXX, MOHELA rightfully placed my loan account in Administrative Forbearance for 60 days processing but also erroneously billed and collected payment from my direct debit account during the same period. I was later contacted by MOHELA in XX/XX/XXXX about this issue and I was offered the choice of a refund for the premature billing/payment I made during that processing administrative forbearance period or I can be reinstated to an equivalent administrative forbearance period which is eligible towards my PSLF counts for the same period to rectify MOHELA 's mistake. I opted for the administrative forbearance reinstatement which the attached documents verifies my administrative forbearance from XXXX to XXXX by MOHELA. I called FSA and was told to submit a document from MOHELA which I obtained and submitted as evidenced and referenced by FSA as Feedback Case # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. FSA has not acted and still erroneously classifying my payments of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as regular forbearance which does not count towards my PSLF eligibility. 
Expected resolution is that FSA update my loan payment history to make my payments months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX qualify and count as Administrative Forbearance as the evidence provided my MOHELA shows which counts towards my PSLF eligibility. 

XXXX. I made full payment for my student loan due for XX/XX/XXXX to MOHELA but on FSA website, XXXX out of my XXXX loans does not reflect my XX/XX/XXXX payment and does showing I missed a payment although for the past 15 years, I made only I payment and its distributed among the XXXX loans which are consolidated into XXXX payment. I have submitted evidence from MOHELA to FSA evidenced by FSA PSLF Reconsideration request case # XXXX but had no response or resolution from FSA despite multiple follow up calls to MOHELA and FSA.

Never once was I told it was denied through any three phone calls. I then called FAFSA after each time I was told they process this by three different aidvantage people. I spoke to 12 people and departments at student aid. Each of them told me that they dont process teacher loan forgiveness paperwork and it was through the lender service. The final aidvantage person I spoke to told me to resubmit the application from XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Which now I know is incorrect. I sent a heated email that afternoon on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX demanding action and response or I would seek legal action. I got an immediate response on XX/XX/XXXX stating it was denied as my school wasnt on the directory. I emailed back stating my school wasnt and that I have the five documents from directory downloaded to show. They then responded my application didnt list my specific school and that it stated I still worked for my district but that the last 3 years my specific schools was listed as low income. I responded back with questions on what specifically they need the services to look like since I still worked for the district and that is what my XXXX XXXX indicated and that I would make sure that the XXXX listed my school specifically as listed in directory. I now will be submitting the application for the fourth time.

I now know this is Incorrect and will have to work with hr to get a new application signed and verified asap and rep loaded to aidvantage.

I formally requested this change from EdFinancial on XX/XX/year> and have not received confirmation that my request has been processed.

If additional processing time is needed, borrowers should be placed in a processing forbearance that provides IDR and PSLF credit. However, EdFinancial has failed to comply with this guidance and has not moved my loans accordingly. This delay is negatively impacting my repayment plan selection, and I am concerned about the improper handling of my account. I request that EdFinancial immediately process my change from SAVE to IBR as required and ensure that my forbearance status, if necessary, aligns with Department of Education policy.

It has been several months since I was placed on deferment, yet I still have not been granted access to my account, preventing me from setting up any type of payment plan. Whenever I attempt to log in, my account remains locked. When I contact MOHELA, they claim I do not have an account, but when I speak with StudentAid.gov, I am informed that my account does indeed exist.

I am deeply concerned that I will be marked as delinquent and unable to make payments on my loans by XX/XX/XXXX, which would have serious financial consequences. It seems as though MOHELA is setting me up for failure, possibly with the intent to issue a garnishment order, which is unfair given that I am actively trying to address my loan situation. 

I am seeking your guidance and support on how to resolve this issue. I have exhausted all available options with MOHELA, and I am unsure how else to proceed.

I was told to consolidate my loans and apply for IDR by a student loan counselor. My payments for the first year should be XXXX because I made very little last year and this year, as reflected on the tax forms attached. I applied to consolidate my loans on XX/XX/XXXX and submitted an IDR application with the consolidation application. My loans were consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX. Soon after that, MOHELA sent me a notice that I was on a standard repayment plan and owed around {$780.00} starting on XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted additional IDR applications on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and nothing happened. I called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX and waited on hold for over an hour just to have the call drop as soon as I was connected to a person. Everyone online said the only way to get through is to call right when they open at XXXX CT, so on XX/XX/XXXX I woke up at XXXX MT so that I could do that. I talked to an agent who requested a processing forbearance be placed on my account, so now my account is in a processing forbearance ending on XX/XX/XXXX. The MOHELA agent said that if my IDR application is not processed by that date I need to call again to get an extension on the processing forbearance. From what I've seen online my time in this forbearance will count towards my 120 PSLF payments, but I'm not totally confident in that so I want to get the IDR application processed to reflect the {$0.00} payments I'll have based on my XXXX tax returns so that they definitely count. I also don't want to have to wake up at XXXX again to call if I can avoid it. I am not sure why my original application from XXXX wasn't processed since they seemed to process the consolidation application so quickly.

Due to serious legal violations and breaches of federal privacy laws including the Family Educations Rights and Privacy Act ( FEPRA ), the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Higher Education Act.

I am filing a formal Complaint under the Family Educations Rights and Privacy Act ( FEPRA ), the Privacy Act of 1974 and the Higher Education Act regarding an unauthorized access and disclosure of my financial aid records, sharing my personal and banking information. I have not given permission to disclose my information. 
It has come to my attention that my personal educational and financial information has been improperly accessed by unauthorized third parties XXXX XXXX, unofficial government entity XXXX, and other possible affiliated entities. 

This unauthorized access constitutes a gross violation of my federal privacy rights and nullifies any enforceable loan agreements under federal law. 

Legal grounds for discharge. 
FERPA violations : The exposure of my educational records without my expressed written consent is a direct breach FERPA, which mandates the protection of personally identifiable information.

Violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 : The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of my personal information contravenes federal requirements that safeguard the privacy of individuals data managed by federal agencies. 

Breach of Higher Education Act : The higher Education Act requires servicers to maintain strict confidentiality and compliance in loan transfers. The transfer of my loan information to XXXX and subsequent data breaches demonstrates clear negligence. 

Demands for Resolution : Due to these violations, I formally demand : Immediate and unconditional cancellation of all financial obligations associated with my student loans. 
Complete removal of all student loan related entries to my credit report. 
Written confirmation of this cancellation and credit correction within 30 days. 

If my demands are not met I reserve the right to pursue all available legal remedies, including claims for damages arising from these privacy breaches and violations of federal law.

01/17/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"Complaint Against Mohela for Failing to Honor General Forbearance Agreement, Interest Accrual Correction, and Repeated Mishandling of My Case 1. Issue Summary I am submitting this complaint because Mohela has failed to honor the general forbearance agreement that was supposed to prevent interest from accruing on my student loans while the injunction for the XXXX repayment plan is in effect. Despite clear guidance from the Department of Education, my loan servicer has allowed interest to accrue, failed to correct the accrued interest, and is now demanding a payment. 

Additionally, I have made repeated attempts over several months to resolve this issue through Mohelas customer service, spending hours on phone calls, only to be met with delays, unhelpful responses, and multiple instances of being hung up on mid-conversation. This has caused significant financial and professional distress. 

I am a XXXX XXXX working an average of XXXX hours per week, earning a modest salary that makes it impossible to afford payments under the XXXX XXXX XXXX. This is precisely why I applied for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ensure my payments would be adjusted based on my income. Mohelas failure to follow federal guidance and place me in the required 0 % interest general forbearance has placed undue financial stress on me. 

XXXX. Relevant Loan Applications & Timeline : - Direct Consolidation Loan Application Submitted : XX/XX/XXXX ( See attached screenshot. ) - Income-Driven Repayment Selection ( SAVE Plan ) Was Part of the Consolidation Loan Application As part of the Direct Consolidation Loan process, I was required to select a repayment plan, and I chose the XXXX Repayment Plan at the time of submission. Because my application has been delayed beyond 60 days, I should have been placed in a general forbearance where no interest accrues, as per the Department of Educations directive. 

3. Mohelas Agreement to Place My Loan in Forbearance Without Interest Accrual The Department of Education clearly states : If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. ( See attached screenshot from the Department of Education website. ) Additionally, Mohela acknowledged this requirement in their own communication, stating : Mohela is in the process of making the necessary system adjustments to your account to apply the 0.00 % interest rate forbearance to your loan. ( See attached Mohela statement. ) Despite this, Mohela has not applied this forbearance correctly, nor have they corrected the improperly accrued interest. 

XXXX. Evidence of Mohelas Non-Compliance & Poor Customer Service - Interest has continued to accrue on my loans, as reflected in my account balance. 
XXXX Mohela has not corrected the interest that already accrued, even though they acknowledged my forbearance should have been interest-free. 
- My Mohela account statement still shows accrued interest, contradicting the agreed-upon forbearance terms. 
XXXX Mohela is now demanding a payment despite my loan being in forbearance. ( See attached account summary screenshot. ) Repeated customer service failures : - I have made multiple phone calls from the summer of XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, spending hours trying to resolve this issue. 

- As a XXXX XXXX working XXXX hours per week, I have had to use my limited days off to make these calls, often spending my entire day off dealing with this issue instead of resting. 

- On multiple occasions, I have been hung up on mid-conversation, and I have proof of these instances. 

- I have received no resolution, only delays and unhelpful responses from Mohela representatives. 

This lack of customer service, failure to follow federal guidelines, and outright negligence by Mohela has made it nearly impossible for me to resolve this situation despite my continued efforts.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,GA,31210,None,Consent provided,Web,01/17/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11658406

Recent investigative reporting from USA TODAY and The Washington Post has confirmed that XXXX XXXX Department of Government Efficiency (XX/XX/XXXX) has been granted unauthorized access to federal student financial aid databases, including the National Student Loan Database System ( NSLDS ) and the Common Origination and Disbursement ( COD ) System. 

The University XXXX California XXXX XXXX has already filed a lawsuit in federal court, accusing XXXX of illegally infiltrating systems that house personal financial aid records. A U.S. Department of Education employee has further confirmed that XXXX team has viewed sensitive financial data of students receiving federal aid. These actions represent a clear violation of FERPA, which mandates that student records can not be accessed without explicit consent, as well as a potential breach of federal regulations governing student loan agreements. 

As a borrower whose financial data has been unlawfully accessed, I believe this compromises the integrity of my loan agreement. If my contract states that unauthorized third-party access voids repayment obligations, then this breach has rendered my agreement unenforceable. I demand the following immediate actions : 1. Formal confirmation from XXXX regarding whether my financial records were accessed or compromised due to this unauthorized breach. 
2. Immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt on the grounds that the agreement has been violated by external interference. 
XXXX. A written response within 30 days outlining the steps being taken to protect my financial information and ensure compliance with federal privacy laws.

If this request is not addressed, I am prepared to escalate this matter through legal action, including joining any class-action lawsuits that may emerge in response to this breach. I will also be filing formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) to investigate this violation of my rights under federal law.

Please respond to this letter as soon as possible to confirm receipt and outline the next steps. If you require additional documentation, I am happy to provide supporting evidence.

02/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Subject : FORMAL DEMAND FOR FULL STUDENT LOAN DISCHARGE FEDERAL PRIVACY VIOLATIONS & ILLEGAL DATA ACCESS To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to demand the full and immediate discharge of my federal student loans due to multiple violations of federal privacy laws, unauthorized access to my loan data, financial risk exposure, and the complete loss of consumer protections due to the illegal dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ).

Recent federal investigations, including reporting from Inside Higher Ed ( link ), confirm that the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) has unlawfully disclosed sensitive borrower data to unauthorized entities, including the Office of Governance and Ethics ( DOGE ). As my loan servicer, XXXX has an obligation under federal law to ensure my personal and financial information is protected, yet my records have been accessed, compromised, and potentially modified without my knowledge or consent. 
Because my student loan records have been unlawfully accessed and my privacy rights have been violated, my federal loans are now subject to immediate discharge under existing legal frameworks. 

I. LEGAL BASIS FOR LOAN DISCHARGE Under federal law, student loans obtained or serviced under unlawful conditions, including violations of privacy rights and unauthorized data disclosures, may be discharged in full. My case qualifies under multiple violations of federal privacy, consumer protection, and financial security laws as follows : 1. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 o My student loan records have been accessed without my consent and disclosed to unauthorized entities, violating FERPA protections.

o The Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) strictly limits third-party data access, yet my financial records have been exposed without notification or consent.

2. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) 15 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.

o XXXX and the Department of Education failed to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to my financial data.

o My personal financial data has been improperly accessed, putting me at significant financial and credit risk.

3. Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.

o If any modifications have been made to my loan balance, terms, or repayment status without my direct authorization, this constitutes an FCRA violation.

4. Privacy Act of 1974 5 U.S.C. 552a o Federal agencies are prohibited from disclosing personal records without explicit consent, yet my student loan data has been accessed by unauthorized entities.

5. Federal Trade Commission Act 15 U.S.C. 45 o The unauthorized access and potential misuse of my financial data constitutes an unfair and deceptive practice under FTC law.

6. Internal Revenue Code 26 U.S.C. 6103 o If my Federal Tax Information ( FTI ) was accessed in connection with my student loan records, this constitutes a federal violation of tax confidentiality laws.

7. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Violations & Loss of Consumer Rights o The illegal shutdown of the CFPB has deprived me of federal oversight, making my student loan obligations inherently unlawful.

o Without the CFPBs enforcement authority, there is no legal regulatory body protecting borrowers from misconduct, placing the full liability for compliance on XXXX

II. DIRECT IMPACT LOSS OF LOAN ENFORCEABILITY My student loan records have been unlawfully accessed, violating multiple federal laws. 
I did not authorize XXXX, the U.S. Department of Education, or any third party to access, share, or alter my student loan data beyond legal servicing requirements. 
Because my financial data has been exposed, my loans have been tainted by unlawful handling and are no longer enforceable under federal lending laws. 
Since the conditions under which my loans were serviced and maintained are unlawful, XXXX can not legally continue to enforce repayment. The only appropriate remedy is immediate loan discharge. 

XXXX. FORMAL DEMAND FOR ACTION I am formally demanding the following actions : Full and immediate discharge of my federal student loans due to unlawful data exposure and privacy violations. 
A written confirmation of which unauthorized entities accessed my records and how XXXX allowed this to occur. 
A full forensic audit of my loan account history to determine if unauthorized modifications were made. 
A formal response within 30 days outlining XXXX corrective actions and compliance measures. 
Failure to comply with this demand will result in immediate legal escalation to : The U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) for a federal investigation into data privacy violations. 
The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for enforcement of consumer protection laws. 
The U.S. Senate Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee for Congressional oversight and intervention. 
If XXXX refuses to act, I will pursue all available legal avenues to ensure that my student loans are discharged and that XXXX is held accountable for its failure to comply with federal consumer protection laws. 

IV. FINAL NOTICE & ESCALATION WARNING I expect a written response and confirmation of loan discharge within 30 days from the date of this letter. Failure to comply will result in immediate legal action. 
XXXX must acknowledge that the conditions under which my loans were managed have been compromised by federal violations, making them unenforceable. 
If no action is taken, I will escalate this case to federal authorities, legal counsel, and media organizations for further exposure.",None,Servicer under contract with Federal Student Aid,KY,40214,None,Consent provided,Web,02/10/25,Untimely response,No,N/A,12025585

Due to serious legal violations and breaches of federal privacy laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Higher Education Act, which my loan servicer, Edfinancial, failed to safeguard. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I became aware of a major breach involving My personal educational and financial information through XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. Despite the public exposure of this security breach accessed by unauthorized third parties, including XXXX XXXX, Co-Head of DOGE ( department of government efficiency ) and/or DOGE Associates .

Under FERPA, my student loan data is protected, and Edfinancial has a legal responsibility to ensure its confidentiality.

2. Violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 : The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of my personal information contravenes federal requirements that safeguard the privacy of individuals ' data managed by federal agencies and contractors.

3. Breach of the Higher Education Act : The Higher Education Act requires servicers to maintain strict confidentiality and compliance in loan transfers. The transfer of my loan to Edfinancial and subsequent data breaches demonstrate clear negligence.

When administrators were contacted since many students intended for the XXXX XXXX XXXX option the administrators of the program said there was no recourse because they did not have a licensed agreement with a Teach Out partner to offer the XXXX XXXX XXXX and they could not do anything. I could have attended another school from the onset to gain a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. Mohela was sent a XXXX XXXX XXXX form soon after I learned I would not be receiving a XXXX XXXX XXXX. They immediately sent me back a notification letter 5 days later stating I was ineligible as the school was not closed. I made over XXXX calls to them to ensure them that the school had notified all students of their permanent closure. Moehela refused to acknowledge this. In turn, I contacted the United States Department of Education where I spoke with the XXXX who oversees the closure of schools she confirmed that XXXX XXXX was in fact on their list and that Mohela has the same information she does. Mohela continued to deny this. I then filed a complaint with Federal Student Aid to which Mohela then contacted me to state that the the form I sent in originally was not signed. Another complaint was filed against Mohela when they continued to not take action the matter was referred to the FSA Ombudsman office to which Mohela was directed to resolve. This was from XX/XX/year> to XX/XX/year>. I immediately used their portal to sign the form and return it to them. I was told my situation had escalated and I would hear back from someone in 15 days. To date, No one has called me regarding the Borrower 's defense. My last correspondence at the beginning of this month was a customer service representative stating that my borrower 's defense was approved since XX/XX/year> however it was a matter of their accounting department wrapping up the issue and that again the matter would be escalated for resolution. To date, I can not get anyone on the phone and it is now almost 8 months since the issue was generated and Mohela has yet to correspond or to update the issue and my account. I have spent upwards of XXXX hours or more on the phone on hold for more than XXXX hours to speak to someone then for them to send me to another department where the wait time is another XXXX hours. Mohela is the worst company to ever have as a student loan borrower and I believe I am due some form of compensation for their inadequate services to me as a student loan borrower.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,PA,18042,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/23/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11739396

This conduct constituted unfair and abusive acts or practices in violation of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 and unfair and unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect debts in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

01/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","To the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, We are writing as a collective group of defrauded students and alumni who attended XXXXaffiliated schools, urging immediate action to approve outstanding Borrower Defense applications and provide full relief for those impacted. 

Many of us attended the following institutions owned by or affiliated with XXXX, where misrepresentations and predatory practices have been well-documented : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The Department of Education has already found significant evidence of misconduct by these schools. Specifically, XXXXXXXX XXXX misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

02/04/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"I submitted an application to MOHELA to change my repayment plan ( attached ) from SAVE to PAYE on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent in a letter as a supplement ( attached ) to expedite processing. I also called MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that my application was received - XXXX ( Worker ID XXXX ) answered and confirmed they received my IDR PAYE Application. 7 months later on XX/XX/XXXX I received a reply from MOHELA denying my application ( attached ) with the reason : "" The version of the form you submitted has expired '' as well as "" Your signature was missing. '' Both mine and my spouse 's signatures are on the application, and the expiration of the form occurred because MOHELA did not process my application for 7 months. If my application had been processed in XX/XX/XXXX, I should have been on the PAYE plan prior to the SAVE court injunction, which began in XX/XX/XXXX. The months since XX/XX/XXXX should count towards my PSLF payment count, but I am missing 6 months as XXXX have been put in forced forbearance, since I could not get off of the SAVE plan given that my application was not processed on time. Because of the forced forbearance, these months have not been counted and it has pushed back my forgiveness by 6 months. My PSLF count should be at XXXX/XXXX, which would include XXXX  as I should have been moved to the PAYE plan before the injunction if MOHELA had processed my application on time. 

It is crucial that my application from XXXX is processed, as my tax information submitted at that time allows me to qualify for the PAYE plan. By not processing my application on time, I am barred from the PAYE plan which prevents me from accessing PSLF benefits that would enable me to pay off my student loan debt sooner. It seems that MOHELA 's delay is intentional as it has forced me into a slower repayment plan requiring about {$3000.00} more in monthly payments. 

I currently have 33 payments left until forgiveness, and a 6-month delay pushes this timeline back, threatening my financial plan developed based on following MOHELA 's instructions. I am seeking to have my XX/XX/XXXX application for the PAYE plan processed so that I can be on the PAYE plan.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,NY,10028,None,Consent provided,Web,02/04/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11935483

However, MOHELA did not "" receive '' my SAVE application until XX/XX/XXXX even though the consolidation and SAVE application were submitted together. Because this was 2 days after XX/XX/XXXX, they told me that this was the reason I could not be placed in the general forbearance that all my colleagues have been placed into where interest does NOT accrue while in forbearance. Initially, I was automatically placed in the standard repayment plan and started getting hefty bills. I was able to reach them a couple of times around XXXX but they said there was nothing they could do about my situation except place me in a processing forbearance where payments were in deferment but interest continued to accrue. To this day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I have had daily interest accrual on my loans and have paid over XXXX in trying to keep debt down. Meanwhile I have been told financial counselors that all applicants to the SAVE plan should be in the general forbearance without interest accrual. But nothing has changed on my loan status.

Despite Mohela being the designated PSLF servicer for over a year before student loan payments were scheduled to resume ( following the COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts ), Mohela has not provided me accurate payment amounts in a timely fashion, has not responded to my phone or email inquiries in their published timeframe, has provided me CONTRADICTORY information regarding forbearances and payment counts, and is now failing to take accountability citing a lack of support from the Department of Education . Mohelas delays, inaccurate and untimely payment information, and inability to provide me with accurate information surrounding my loans and the PSLF program breach its responsibilities and duties. Inaccurate payment counts towards the required 120 payments for PSLF have been questioned by me ( either via phone or email/online chat ), and requests to be removed from forbearances that I did not consent to have been ignored or delayed such that a loss in ability to make qualifying payments has occurred. After being forced into a SAVE-related forbearance, Mohela was unable to process IDR-plan applications except for the Income-Based Repayment ( standard IBR ) option, leaving borrowers only one option for a payment plan that counted towards PSLF. A borrowers Defense Application was submitted by me to the Federal Student Aid in XXXX XXXX XXXX and as part of that application I requested ( documented in a saved copy of the signed application ) NOT to be placed in a forbearance so that my payments ( even the {$0.00} CARES Act ones ) would continue to count towards PSLF.

After calling Mohela to dispute the issues, with signed and dated proof of their error, they did not remove the forbearance in a timely manner and payment ( s ) that should have counted towards my PSLF were deemed not-qualifying. They also did not provide a reason for THEIR error.

This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

On XX/XX/2024, I received a letter from the XXXX XXXX stating my loans were being placed into a forbearance with 0 % interest and that no interest would accrue during this forbearance. A copy of this letter will be provided upon request. I also received my XXXX billing statement which reflected the correct totals for interest and principal for all loans. Interest continued to accrue so I contacted MOHELA by phone and a representative informed me the problem would be corrected and the incorrectly accrued interest would be backdated. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA via email because interest was still accruing on my account. I received a response that the problem has been rectified even though interest was still accruing. 

On XX/XX/2024, interest again capitalized on my accounts. I contacted MOHELA and was informed the capitalized interest would be removed and the interest that incorrectly accrued would be backdated and payments would be reapplied. 

On XX/XX/2024, interest capitalized on my accounts again. I contacted MOHELA and the representative was able to correct the capitalized interest to reflect {$0.00}. But I was told the incorrectly accrued interest was still being reviewed and it would take some time to receive a resolution. 

In XXXX, I was placed into the XXXX forbearance with 0 % interest. The XXXX interest issue was still not addressed and interest continued to accrue. On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA to let them know interest was still accruing and nothing had been done to address the incorrectly accrued interest. I received a response saying my account was in a XXXX forbearance and explaining what the FORBEARANCE was for and why my billing statements would be delayed. 

On XX/XX/2024, interest capitalized on my account and interest was still accruing. I contacted MOHELA by phone and spoke to a representative that informed me they could correct the interest capitalization but my account would need to be corrected by a supervisor to remove the interest that accrued while I was in the 0 % forbearance and to ensure the payments I made during that time were correctly applied to my account. I was told it would take some time for this to be completed as there had been many issues like what I was experiencing. I contacted MOHELA in XXXX and was told by a representative the request had been elevated and to allow more time before calling back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contact MOHELA via email because the incorrectly accrued interest was still not addressed. I received a generic response providing information about the XXXX forbearance, but my problem was not rectified. 

On XX/XX/2024, interest capitalized on my account again and interest was still accruing. I called and was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX. XXXX was able to review the billing statements in my account and determine not all of my loans had been placed into the 0 % forbearance which was why interest was still accruing. He was able to set the interest rate to 0 % on all of my loans, but was unable to correct the amounts. He could not explain why interest had capitalized several times in a few months. XXXX put in a request to correct my interest and principal balances to reflect the correct amounts. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. I was transferred to the supervisor XXXX again. He was able to locate the problem immediately and determine the correct interest and principal balances. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

On XX/XX/2024, I contacted MOHELA because the interest and principal balances were still not corrected. 

At this point, I have spoken to several supervisors at MOHELA, including XXXX, and all have informed me that my total interest is {$3000.00}, and the total principal is {$150000.00}. The individual loans are as follows : Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$1400.00}. XXXX Principal- {$22000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$1200.00}. XXXX Principal- {$20000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$110.00}. XXXX Principal- {$6600.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$3400.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$220.00}. XXXX Principal- {$24000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$64.00}. XXXX Principal- {$20000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$8000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$4500.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$5400.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$11000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$10000.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$5300.00}. Loan XXXX : Total interest- {$0.00}. XXXX Principal- {$10000.00}. 

This is a substantial difference from what MOHELA is reporting. Additionally, multiple MOHELA supervisors have done an accounting and determined because there are multiple loans, some loans were placed in the XXXX  forbearance while others were not. The supervisors all informed me this has been a reoccurring issue for people with multiple loans. I have been told since I was first placed on the XXXX administrative forbearance with 0 % interest in XXXX and interest continued to accrue, that this issue would be corrected. Then when I was placed into the XXXX forbearance in XXXX and interest continued to accrue, I was told the payments I made would be reapplied to the account and the accrued interest would be removed. Yet somehow I continue to get a generic response from MOHELA that no interest accrued during the XXXX forbearance and my interest is {$4000.00}. Despite speaking to multiple supervisors at MOHELA that have found that interest did accrue, MOHELA continues to respond to complaints stating no interest can accrue during the XXXX forbearance. It seems just because MOHELA states that no interest accrued, no one will do an investigation to see that MOHELA is wrong and not doing it's job properly. It's concerning that when I call and speak to a supervisor, my issue is immediately found, but MOHELA continues to deny the problem. It is even more concerning that the company is mishandling loans and no one will do anything about it. To further complicate the matter, many people just believe MOHELA because they trust MOHELA will properly service their loans. The ramification of this massive accounting error has resulted in incorrect interest, incorrect principal balances which increases the amount of interest i will pay, and incorrect credit reporting. It's pathetic that I reep all of the consequences of MOHELA 's fraudulent behavior and no one can or will help me.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,IN,46311,None,Consent provided,Web,01/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11527303

01/14/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Hello, I am writing to express my urgent concern about the detrimental effects of the SAVE Plan on borrowers like me, specifically the inability to opt out and resume repayment under another Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan. As someone actively working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), this policy is creating unnecessary financial strain and disrupting my repayment strategy. 

The current situation under the SAVE Plan has placed my loans in administrative forbearance, preventing me from resuming payments under a different IDR plan. According to MOHELA, my only option for exiting the SAVE Plan is to choose a full-term non-IDR repayment plan, which is entirely incompatible with my financial circumstances and PSLF eligibility . This lack of an exit strategy from SAVE, other than committing to an unaffordable plan, is not only unfair but also deeply harmful to millions of borrowers. 

The administrative forbearance and restrictive policies of SAVE are undermining the very purpose of IDR plansto provide flexible and affordable repayment options based on a borrower 's income. By denying borrowers the ability to switch plans, the administration is forcing us into financial uncertainty and jeopardizing access to critical programs like PSLF. 

I respectfully urge you to advocate for immediate policy changes, including : - Allowing borrowers to exit the SAVE Plan and transition to other IDR plans without barriers. 
- Ensuring clear communication and transparency about repayment options for borrowers affected by SAVE. 
- Protecting PSLF-eligible borrowers from policies that disrupt their repayment strategies and harm their financial stability. 

Borrowers should have the autonomy to choose repayment plans that align with their needs and goals. The inability to leave the SAVE Plan for a suitable IDR option is causing unnecessary harm and demands immediate attention. 

Thank you for your leadership and your commitment to addressing these pressing concerns. I look forward to seeing action on behalf of borrowers like me who are seeking fair and equitable treatment in managing our student loans.

Based on these violations, I demand the immediate cancellation of all financial obligations related to these debts.

Legal Violations Supporting My Demand for Cancellation 1. FERPA Violations : My personal and financial information may have been disclosed without my consent to unauthorized third parties, violating my privacy rights.

Inaccurate or misleading loan records may have been maintained, and I was not given proper access to review and correct them.

2. Privacy Act of 1974 Violations : If my loan records were mishandled by the Department of Education or Advantage, it constitutes a violation of federal data protection laws.

If my Social Security Number or other personal information was shared without my authorization, my rights under the Privacy Act were infringed.

3. Higher Education Act Violations : If I was misled about loan terms, repayment obligations, or forgiveness options, it constitutes a violation under HEA.

If my school improperly certified my eligibility for loans or engaged in fraudulent practices, I should not be held responsible for this debt.

Additionally, it has come to my attention that my personal educational and financial information has been improperly accessed by unauthorized third parties, including Elon Musk or affiliated entities. This unauthorized access constitutes a gross violation of my federal privacy rights and nullifies any enforceable loan agreement under federal law.

Demands for Resolution Immediate and unconditional cancellation of all financial obligations associated with my student loans.

Complete removal of all Advantage-related entries from my credit report.

Written confirmation of this cancellation and credit correction within 30 days of receipt of this letter.

Failure to comply with this request will result in formal complaints being filed with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).

Upon reviewing my payment history and loan agreement, I noticed that I have paid more than three times the original loan ( $ XXXX ) amount in interest alone ( $ XXXX ). This situation feels unreasonable and financially burdensome. 

While I understand the terms of the loan were agreed upon initially, the extent of the interest far exceeds what I believe to be fair or competitive compared to other lending options. It is disheartening to see that such terms heavily penalize borrowers and make it exceedingly difficult to pay off the principal amount.

01/29/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"I have been enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment plan for many years. I need to re-apply annually to continue being enrolled in this program. After I re-enrolled in XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX calendar year, it takes nearly a month to learn what your new payment amount will be. And after you receive the notice with information about your new payment, you are provided with less than 30 days notice of the new payment amount, which isnt a lot of time to be able to process and figure out how to absorb the higher payment, if indeed your payment amount will increase, as mine did by nearly XXXX the previous payment amount. 
Immediately after receiving notice of my pending new payment amount for XXXX, I immediately reached out to an ombudsman since I believed this amount to be incorrect. I also stated my position that I could not afford this new payment, since I was barely able to afford the 2024 monthly payment amount. 
I asked if mortgage or rents were taken into consideration, since currently, most consumers ( me included ) are paying 2 to 4 times more in rent or mortgage than we were paying prior to XXXX and XXXX. I was very rudely informed that this information wasnt considered and basically, didnt matter to the federal government. 
I currently rent, since I am priced out of the market as a single person trying to buy a home with the equally unaffordable current mortgage interest rates. And as such, I am at the mercy of whatever market rates are for apartments. Rents are outrageous since there are a lot of people in similar financial dire straights of being kept out of homeownership by housing prices and mortgage rates, therefore due to increased demand for rental properties, monthly rents have increased 2 and 3-fold. This information absolutely should be taking into consideration. Should someone be homeless just to be able to pay their student loan payment? Because currently that is the choice I am facing.either pay my rent OR pay my student loan payments, income-based as they may be. I can not afford both. I actually can not even currently afford food, I only eat because of my local food pantry. 
After I reached out to Mohela for assistance with my payment and to immediately inform them that I could not pay the increased amount for XXXX, and also to complain that 30 days is just not enough time to increase someones payment by nearly 3x the amount, it took well over a week to investigate and receive a response. This used up a lot of valuable time in my 30-day window notification of my pending payment increase. I find this response time completely unacceptable. 
The bottom line is I was told to use the online portal to seek an alternate payment plan or request for temporary postponement of payments. 
After utilizing the portal and applying for a temporary forbearance, I was denied a forbearance and given a reason of having used up my allotment of forbearance time ( due to being seriously ill for many years, nearly unable to work ), so I attempted to apply for economic hardship deferment. It seems the economic hardship deferment criteria has now changed and you need to be receiving public assistance or not working to qualify for economic hardship deferment. 
Which leaves me with trying to find another payment plan. 
I had also repeatedly DIRECTLY asked the Mohela service rep for other repayment options to lower my payment amount, and I shared with this person that I was aware that if I opted out of the current payment plan I was in, it would automatically revert my payments back to full payments, which I would be required to make at least one month of payments before I could apply for a different payment plan. However, this would only exacerbate the problem, since if I could not afford the reduced payment under the income-based payment plan, how was I supposed to afford a full payment for even one month? This is the horrible loop they put you in, with no way out, no empathy or XXXXXXXX XXXX  to the problem of not being able to afford the payment. 
In addition, now my car has serious mechanical issues, and I will need to find some money somewhere to fix it or I will also be out of a job. I drive a nearly XXXX old car, and I only have food because I visit the food pantry. 
There needs to be BETTER SOLUTIONS to real financial issues people are facing. This is not a joke to me and I am not trying to get out of paying. I have been repeatedly asking for help, and proactively BEFORE my next ( increased ) monthly payment, because I desperately do not want to default on my loans. 
I am being treated harshly and being railroaded at every turn. There have to be WORKABLE solutions for people who are struggling to pay and who are asking for help and needing options that fit their circumstances. 
There needs to be more forbearance and deferment time, especially for people like me who had extended health challenges that I didnt ask for. 
This entire system is broken and rigged against the borrowers.there needs to be at least XXXX to 90 days notice of payment increases on your loan, so people struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on their table can figure out where the money will come from. 
You should also be able to refinance student loan interest, just like you can refinance your mortgage interest. Without losing all your time in repayment.

01/31/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"All of the below issues occurred with the same loan service provider, Mohela. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, due to a personal miscommunication, both my spouse and I made a pay in full payment to the provider to pay off my student loans, in the amount of {$9300.00} ( due to the duplicative payment, the initial total submitted was {$18000.00} ). When we realized the error ( our bank flagged what would have been an overdraft ), I contact the provider to ask them to stop the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed that the payments were already processing on their end, so the only solution was to contact my bank and stop the payment, which I then did. Because it was a duplicative payment to the same vendor, the stopping of one would trigger ( according to the bank ) the stopping of both. I said ok and asked them to stop the payment. 

Here begins the source of the issue and the complaint. 

I waited for a few business days to allow the provider 's system to process the payment, the cancellation, and update my account so I could make payments. I then called on XX/XX/XXXX to ask for an update on when the status would clear. I was told to wait until the account was reconciled, as that could take XXXX business days. I then called back on XX/XX/XXXX for an update, at which point I was given the same general advice. 

At this point, rather than showing that the account had not been paid, it was appearing on my account that I had not only not paid the amount, but I had overpaid by double the amount. I proceeded to tell them that, despite their records, they had not received their money at all ( I could verify that it had never left my bank account ). I was told they put a note in my account and would flag it for review. I waited for another billing cycle to move through in case it needed time to get to accounting when they reconciled their books. Over this time, nothing in my account changed. Each time I had communicated with a representative, they assured that I was not being charged, nor would I be charged, interest. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and finally was able to speak to a supervisor that pushed the review through to accounting. She told me to give it XXXX business days and I would be contacted by accounting once the issue was resolved. I was never contacted by accounting. 

I then logged into my account on XX/XX/XXXX to see that my account had been reversed and I now owed {$18000.00} and they were processing a refund for the amount they had originally thought I overpaid. The refund for {$9300.00} posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, and I have not yet received this refund check ( as of today, XX/XX/XXXX ). I called and asked them to stop the payment on the refund check, and clear my account back to the original amount owed to I could pay it off. 

Additionally, when they reconciled the account to reverse the payment they had posted but not received, they back-dated the posting to XX/XX/XXXX, and then added the interest that would have accrued on an $ XXXX loan over the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ( which I had been assured would not happen each time I called ). 

The account is still accruing interest. 

I have since called on the following dates : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX Each call involved XXXX hours of wait time to reach a supervisor ( often a XXXX hour wait to reach an initial rep who then connects me with someone from the resolutions team, requiring an additional wait. Previous calls have had a callback option, preventing extended holds, but they have since removed the callback option and required a live hold. I have been on hold today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for XXXX hours with still not contact from a representative. 

The latest activity on my account, communicated with a resolutions representative on XX/XX/XXXX was that I would pay my initial balance ( {$9300.00} ) and they were to put an inquiry through to the accounting department to remove the accrued interest since the start of this event, and stop payment of the refund check. This would result in my account being cleared to zero balance and the end of the issue. I was also told I would receive communication from the accounting department when this was resolved. 

I have since paid my portion, and the payment posted on XX/XX/XXXX. I was informed on my check in call on XX/XX/XXXX to give the department XXXX business days to resolve the inquiry. It has been XXXX business days, I have not received any updates, and my account still includes a balance for the refund they sent ( which I still have not received and have asked them to stop payment on multiple times ) and accrued interest. I am currently on hold ( XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, current hold time XXXX XXXX minutes ) to inquire about a final resolution. For obvious reasons, I am not confident of the services ability to reconcile this issue.

Despite my proactive efforts, including multiple hours-long phone calls with MOHELA customer service representatives, to ensure my loans were placed in a 0 % interest forbearance as directed by the DoEand as confirmed in two letters from MOHELA dated XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXXMOHELAs negligence has caused undue stress and potential financial harm. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for federal direct loan consolidation through Studentaid.gov to enroll in the new XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and benefit from the One-Time Payment Count Adjustment, as encouraged by the XXXX Administration. As a XXXX XXXX I indicated my eligibility for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) Program and applied for the XXXX XXXX plan. My loans were consolidated and assigned to MOHELA for servicing on XX/XX/XXXX. However, due to a federal court injunction preventing the implementation of XXXX  while my application was processing, MOHELA was unable to process my XXXX XXXX request and instead placed me on a standard repayment plan, which I did not request and which does not qualify for XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted MOHELA for an update on my XXXX application and to explore repayment options, as the standard repayment plan was unaffordable and did not qualify for XXXX. MOHELA placed me on a XXXX processing forbearance while awaiting updates on the XXXX litigation. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX, to extend the processing forbearance for another 60 days, as there had been no progress on my XXXX XXXX request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from MOHELA assuring me that my student loans were placed in forbearance at 0 % interest due to either ( 1 ) the federal court injunction affecting the XXXX plan and other XXXX plans, or ( XXXX ) their failure to process my IDR application within the required 60-day timeframe. However, despite this confirmation, MOHELA failed to implement the forbearance properly, causing my account to become delinquent in XXXX. 

I contacted MOHELA at least XXXX separate times, spending hours on hold to speak with a representative, only to be transferred to an "" advanced team, '' in an effort to have my account updated in accordance with the letters I had received. Despite repeated assurances from multiple customer service representatives, MOHELA failed to process my request, and my account remains marked as delinquent. 

I have made every reasonable effort to resolve this issue directly with MOHELA, yet they have been unresponsive and unwilling to take appropriate action to correct their mistake, adhere to DoE guidance, and process my forbearance request. Their failure to act is unacceptable and has caused unnecessary financial and emotional distress while also putting me at risk of defaulting on my loans. 

I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and hold MOHELA accountable for its negligence. Furthermore, I urge MOHELA to retroactively apply the 0 % interest forbearance, backdated to no later than XX/XX/XXXX, as originally intended, and correct any negative impact this delinquency has had on my loan balance, credit report, or loan status, including the removal of any accrued interest. 

Thank you for your time and attention to this serious matter. Please let me know if any further documentation is required. I appreciate your prompt assistance in resolving this issue.

This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

01/16/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I attended XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX to XXXX for their masters, then doctoral graduate programs. When I initially enrolled, it was XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, it was focused on small class size, applicable clinical skills and focusing on the student. It was a hard program to get into then. The program was very high regarded in our community as an institution to train clinical psychologists as stellar treatment providers. 

The year after I began, XXXX took over. The class sizes grew massively each year. The teachers were exhausted and overwhelmed. The program was disorganized as they became a mill for graduate students. I recall my professors being concerned about the class sizes and that students were not capable of graduate work. They had to institute a writing program for over 50 % of students as many were writing at a high school level. It was terrible. I decided to stay because I was already so far into my program and I did not want to have to start over. I tutored the writing program and continued to be one of the top students of my class. 

In my XXXX year, we had to take comprehensive exams. I took my exams and it took about XXXX weeks for the results. When my results came, it said that I had failed my exam. I was devastated. It was also time to apply for internships so I had to wait until my peers applications went out before my advisor had time to review my exam with me. I will never forget when she handed me my exam and I was so confused. In order to not show bias, we were expected to give our exams with only our social security number- not our names. The exam that was handed to me was not my social security number nor my exam. They had mixed them up. 

I learned that I had actually passed my exams and did not need to retake them. However, it was too late for internship and I had to wait another year. I was devastated. My parents wanted to sue the school. I refused because I was desperate for my degree. The school agreed that I could do an advanced practicum at no cost for the year, while I waited to apply to internship. 

I decided to move to FL to do my internship because my classes were all complete and all I had was this practicum, internship, and my dissertation left. I found my own practicum in XXXX XXXX. Then I started getting bills for tuition. I reminded them of what they said and they claimed that they could not fix it because the system would not allow them override tuition so I had to pay it to stay in the program. Another year of tuition. 

The following year came and I applied for internships. I was focused on XXXX XXXX  because my grades were good and I had another year of training. I applied to several child neuropsychology programs that were competitive. I practiced interviews and worked hard to be able to prove myself worthy of their programs. Then the rejection letters arrived. Turned out the internship advisor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, had accidentally checked that I was on academic probation and I was not. She wrote letters to correct her errors, but it was too late. I was left with waiting yet another year or finding an XXXX XXXX. I went with the XXXX  because I just wanted to graduate. 

Post graduation, I had been told my dissertation was approved. I decided not to return to campus for the graduation ceremony because I was too disenchanted with the program. I went right into my post-doc program. I was about 2 months in and my diploma still had not arrived. I called my school and was told that I had to finish edits for the librarian on my dissertation and they would not send me my degree until she approved it. I was also told that if I didnt get it done, I needed to pay another semester of tuition. I literally made the edits the day she sent them to me. I had to stop my post-doc program until I got my degree. It took another 2 months. 

I share this with you because I worked while in grad school to keep my loans at a minimum. However, due to XXXX mistakes, I had XXXX extra years of tuition. Additionally, with having attended an XXXX  XXXX, there are many jobs for which I am not qualified because they require an XXXX XXXX- particularly federal jobs. 

Currently, I have been paying 15 years on my student loans, with little reduction. I can not work for a place that would offer loan forgiveness because I did not have an XXXX internship. 100 % of my student loans are from XXXX XXXX. The current balance is {$130000.00} in the form of XXXX federal loans. The original amounts were {$50000.00} & {$98000.00}, totaling {$140000.00}. My current loan payment is about 13 % of my income. 

It would be such a gift and relief to have my loans forgiven. It would help with the healing from the trauma of a subpar program for which I am still indebted even though they were able to file bankruptcy and start again. 

I work hard, often over XXXX hours a week. I am fortunate to have obtained my degree and licensure. However, I am still left with considerable debt for a program that failed me along with so many others. If you are able to push through and allow XXXX students loan forgiveness as the government has done for other defunct programs, it would definitely help XXXX of students who were taken advantage of. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX University borrowers sent the Department of Education XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Defrauded a Generation of Students and the Federal Government that detailed copious evidence collected by XXXX borrowers themselves.

I made a XXXX payment. This is documented in my payment history. Within 1-2 weeks, the Mohela site said my payment was late. I called and spent an hour on the phone. The Mohela rep confirmed that my XXXX payment was processed. She said from her end she did not see any missed or late payments and assured me it was a website glitch. Further, she told me the SAVE injunction was about to go into effect, and I would be placed in a forbearance so the next months payment would not even be due. Which is exactly what happened. So THERE ARE NO MISSED PAYMENTS. Still, it has continued to show a late/missing payment. I spent 2.5hrs on the phone with Mohela just this week. Neither of the two reps I spoke to could see a late payment. I called Federal Student Aid today because I have done what I need to do to achieve forgiveness. Surprise! FSA says the problem is Mohela showing a late payment. I now have FOUR days before the administration changes and further litigation and red tape is likely. Because of these things, which are beyond my control, I am now missing out on forgiveness. I dont deserve this. Mohela is completely incompetent and impossible to deal with.

This letter also states, "" interest continues to accrue on your loan ( s ) during the forbearance period, '' which conflicts with information I received in the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX.

01/15/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Statement of Events : I began my student loan journey in XXXX when I XXXX  enrolled in school. Over the years, I encountered periods of deferment during which I was not required to make payments. While these deferment periods do not count toward qualifying payments for the federal student loan forgiveness program, I have identified that payments made between XXXX and XXXX are missing from my payment history. Given the persistent misinformation from Nelnet, I have concerns that other qualifying payments may also be absent from the records. 

Throughout the life of my loans, they were serviced by several loan servicers, including Great Lakes. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were transferred to Nelnet. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, I contacted Nelnet multiple times to inquire about the process of consolidating my loans. I was advised by a Nelnet representative that consolidation was the only method to qualify for the federal student loan forgiveness program. Subsequently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I requested my payment count to date, but I was informed that this information could not be provided until after the consolidation was completed. 

Following the guidance provided by Nelnet, I submitted my consolidation application, which was approved, and I was placed on the XXXX plan on XX/XX/XXXX. 

After completing the consolidation, I was alerted to a significant drop in my credit scoreover XXXX points. I was never informed by Nelnet that consolidating my loans would negatively affect my credit, particularly because this loan was my longest-standing account. This dramatic decline in my credit score has adversely impacted my ability to secure housing, obtain an auto loan, rent a home, and may potentially affect my ability to secure employment, as many employers conduct credit checks. This decision was based on erroneous advice from Nelnet, which has had a profound negative impact on my financial standing and future opportunities. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Nelnet containing my payment history. However, the document was filled with unreadable and nonsensical information. I contacted Nelnet again, and on XX/XX/XXXX, the consolidation was completed. Once again, I received a document containing incomprehensible data. I was subsequently informed by a Nelnet representative that previous representatives had provided inaccurate information and that the consolidation needed to be completed before XX/XX/XXXX. Despite my repeated requests, I was still unable to obtain an accurate payment count. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, another Nelnet representative informed me that my payment count would be sent to me via mail, which would take XXXX months. In the summer of XXXX, I received a letter from Nelnet ; however, it only contained loan amounts and did not include the requested payment history. Upon contacting Nelnet again, I was told that the prior information provided was incorrect and that I would have to wait until the end of the year for the one-time payment adjustment to be processed. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I had still received no satisfactory resolution, prompting me to file a formal complaint with the Department of Education. In response, Nelnet stated that "" the consolidation resulted in paying off your original loan balance '' and that consolidation was recommended to expedite eligibility for the one-time account adjustment. However, this adjustment failed to reflect payments made from XXXX to XXXX, as well as potentially other periods of qualifying payments. As a result, my payment count was not properly adjusted. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet responded again, inaccurately stating that I was concerned because my previous loans were listed as "" paid in full. '' This statement is incorrect, as I never made such a claim. It was Nelnet that informed me that my loans were paid in full. Furthermore, I never stated that my payment count was incorrect ; I simply requested an accurate payment count, which I had yet to receive. 

After over a year of waiting, Nelnet has provided a payment count, but it still contains inaccuracies. It shows that I owe XXXX additional payments, extending my repayment period until XX/XX/XXXX. While the months I was enrolled in school in XXXX are not eligible, they should still be listed, as my current in-school deferment is clearly labeled as ineligible. The count also fails to account for months from XXXX to XXXX when I was neither in school nor in an in-school deferment due to a family medical emergency. These months should have been counted as qualifying payments, yet Nelnet does not show them at all, even though the Department of Education records show that I had a loan during this period. Unlike my current in-school deferment, which is clearly marked as ineligible, these missing months should have been listed with the same level of detail, indicating whether they are eligible or ineligible. I understand that my loan servicer has changed several times over the past XXXX  years, but I have already made enough qualifying payments for loan forgiveness, and this issue needs to be rectified as soon as possible to accurately reflect my eligibility. 

To summarize, I have spent countless hours trying to get resolution however, Nelnet 's failure to provide accurate information regarding loan consolidation, combined with incomplete and incorrect payment records, has caused significant financial hardship and emotional distress. My credit score has dropped dramatically, and I was misinformed about the necessity of consolidation. Consequently, my loans have not been processed properly for forgiveness. I believe that the missing payments from XXXX to XXXX, as well as other potentially qualifying months, should be properly accounted for in the one-time payment adjustment. I should also have been fully informed of the impact of consolidation on my credit. 

As a result of Nelnets actions, my credit score has been severely impacted, placing me in a poor credit category, which affects my ability to purchase a vehicle, secure housing, or rent a home. Additionally, should I be applying for employment that involves a credit check, my chances of securing the job could be adversely affected. I respectfully request that Nelnet take immediate action to rectify these issues, provide an accurate payment count, and process my loan forgiveness in accordance with the guidelines of the federal student loan forgiveness program.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",KY,40475,None,Consent provided,Web,01/15/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11556953

01/23/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","XXXX : My concern with my loan provider ( XXXX ) at the time was that they continued to break apart and sell my loans causing me to have multiple student loan bills which forced me to either have missed payments ( marked on my credit ) due to multiple payments required and or have to continue to periodically call to consolidate the loans which changed the terms of the loan. 

XXXX : I found out that I qualified as a teacher working 5 years in my district for teacher loan forgiveness. I contacted my loan provider at the time, XXXX to inquire and the representative told me no such program existed and didn't know what I was referring to. This was baffling because I was able to locate, via online search, loan forgiveness paperwork but I did not know where or how to best submit it given the representative 's response. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I attempted calling again and was told that I could be enrolled in a "" program '' that would allow me to take advantage of teacher loan forgiveness. I asked if that would go into effect as of XXXX ( or after completing the XXXX school year ) since at that time I would have taught for 10 years. I was told "" no '' and that it would be 10 years from the date I signed up for the program, seeing no other options in taking advantage of the teacher loan forgiveness initiative, I signed up for the program, and my loans moved from XXXX to Mohela. The Mohela customer service is difficult to reach in that I have on numerous occasions called and either sat on hold waiting for a representative anywhere from XXXX hours, I have tried using the option to "" save my spot '' and have someone call back and never received a return call ( on XXXX different occasions ). They have changed their website so I am no longer able to access and manage my information and have moved their platform to the studentaid.gov website. 

XXXX : I completed and had my most recent degree conferred in XX/XX/XXXX, according to my understanding - loans are not to go back into repayment until XXXX after completion of the degree program or 6 months after I discontinue if I choose to pause my program. This would mean that I would not go into repayment until XX/XX/XXXX. I received postal mail in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX of XXXX telling me that I have a bill due or past due. I called twice during that time to let them know that this was inaccurate. On the first call, the representative told me that I would have to be in repayment despite what I said to them about the 6 months rule and told me the best they could do was put me on deferment until XX/XX/XXXX and I could call back again if I needed to. I called back again closer to that time and spoke with a different representative and they understood and agreed with my statements about the 6 months. At that time, they stated that repayment would not begin until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked about the past due notices and I was told that they would go away and would not be reflected on my credit ( and or removed if already there ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received XXXX envelopes each from Mohela regarding my loan, the first I opened just stated that I was past due on my payments, the second stated I was past due in an amount of over {$700.00}, and the third I opened stated I was past due in an amount of over {$400.00}. The fourth envelope had notice that my new monthly payment is {$250.00} beginning on XX/XX/XXXX. The prior XXXX envelopes opened also had a due date of XX/XX/XXXX.

01/17/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"In XX/XX/year> ( CFPB ID : XXXX ) I asked why my SAVE application was not processed AND/OR PLACED IN FORBEARANCE WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUAL. On XX/XX/year>XXXX  - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/year> you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/year>, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issue. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint ( https : //www.ed.gov/higher-education/manage-your-loans/save-plan ) ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/year>, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/scrub>XXXX XXXX borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. 

For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. 

Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation.

If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",NJ,08054,None,Consent provided,Web,01/17/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11560617

I have double-checked with the college, and it has been confirmed by a MOHELA representative that, the college notified MOHELA at the end of XXXX of my XXXX graduation date. Yet, MOHELA did not move my loans into repayment at the end of the six-month grace period. After OVER A MONTH of trying to get this corrected, and after two different representatives claimed that they'd put in the request and that I wouldnot be penalized for the unpaid months, my loans still have not been moved into repayment. 

WHAT I'VE DONE TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE : XXXX - I tried calling, but got put on hold for over two hours just to speak to someone who could not help me and put me on hold for another XXXX  hours. I finally spoke to a representative about this issue after three hours. She admitted that this was strange and that everything had been done correctly on the college 's end, but MOHELA had not transferred me into repayment at the proper time - something that normally happens automatically. She said she put in the request for changes to be made ( my loans would be moved into repayment, and any unpaid loan payments for months after the grace period where I was not notified would be put into forbearance so I would not be penalized ), and that it should happen within XXXX days and that I would receive an email with my first payment amount and due date. 
XXXX Amidst all the holds, I sent a message via their online portal detailing my situation. 
- They responded after my call noting that I had already spoken to a representative, and therefore my issue had been resolved. 
XXXX There were still no changes to my account, so I sent another message through the MOHELA portal detailing, again, my situation, and asking for someone to help me. 
- I eventually received a response - sometime between XXXX letting me know how they move students out of deferment after a school sends information, etc. They said I should respond to the email if I wanted to make a special request to move my student loans out of deferment while I am still in school - so clearly they did not read my message. Also- they don't have a reply button for customers, so I can not respond to their emails, and I have to keep sending new messages every time. 
XXXX I emailed through the MOHELA portal again, this time under the category of "" Complaints ''. 
- I still have not received a response. 
XXXX I tried calling. After XXXX hours, I finally talked to XXXX - She immediately transferred me to an advanced agent. The estimated wait time for the advanced agent was another XXXX hours and XXXX minutes.

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions. 
2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

So I have the following questions : 1. Shouldnt my refunds from XXXX XXXX XXXX  case 1 have been sent to me directly and not applied to my outstanding principle balance for XXXX XXXX in borrower defense case 2? 
2. What action do I need to take and who do I take it with? 
3. If my borrower defense case for XXXX is eventually approved, but that balance has been discharged under the IDR forgiveness, will I still receive a retro-active refund of money that I paid on those loans, including the refund payments that were applied to them? 

I was considered a class member of the XXXX case for my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I applied for borrower defense for my XXXX loans on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I received notification on XX/XX/XXXX, from the Department of Education, that my application was approved. 
My studentaid data history shows that Aidvantage applied XXXX XXXX related refunds to my OPB for my remaining XXXX balance, rather than issue a refund directly to me. This is what I see : o Refund 1 : Loan Disbursement Amount : {$23000.00} Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge Type Code : XXXX Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge Type Code Description : Borrower Defense Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge XXXX Amount of Discharge : {$8400.00} Amount of Discharge Applied to OPB : {$8400.00} Amount of Discharge Applied to OIB : {$0.00} o Refund 2 : Loan Disbursement Amount : {$11000.00} Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge Type Code : XXXX Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge Type Code Description : Borrower Defense Aid Recipient 's Loan Discharge XXXX Amount of Discharge : {$4700.00} Amount of Discharge Applied to OPB : {$4700.00} Amount of Discharge Applied to OIB : {$0.00} I applied for borrower defense for my XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I was considered a post-class member of the case for my second borrower defense application. 
I have been told that the Dept. of Edu. has until XXXX to respond to this second application. If they do not, the loans would be automatically discharged. 

I received notification on XX/XX/XXXX, from the Department of Education, that I received a full discharge of my remaining balances for XXXX because I was paying on an IDR plan for XXXX years. But the second borrower defense case is still pending. 

I sent multiple inquiries about this on the studentaid.gov website which received no response. 

I created a dispute case with the Department of Education. I received an email from Ombudsman XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were working on the case. I emailed requesting a status update on XX/XX/XXXX which went unanswered. I sent another email requesting an update again today. 

I sent inquiries on the Aidvantage website and I also called customer service to inquire about this. The staff seemed to be uneducated about the XXXX ruling forbidding them from applying my first case refund to the loans contained in the second case. They were not helpful and always told me they could not do anything and that I had to talk to the Department of Education. The Dept. of Ed told me to talk to Aidvantage about it.

01/06/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"As referenced in Complaint ID XXXX, Mohela has failed to process both forbearance and an IDR plan in a timely manner, leading to having payed close to {$1000.00} despite my financial situation changing drastically. To compound on this, the customer service is unreachable. Their automated phone customer service agent can not verify my social security number despite having been serviced by them for years, and when it finally verified my account number after several CORRECT attempts, I've been placed on hold for exorbitant amounts of hours -- to the point where it would dominate entire days simply to talk to a human being that works for the company. 

After all of this in my previous complaint, I was forced to pay yet another {$430.00} to my loan payments while in limbo, and on top of that, they are charging me an EXTRA {$430.00} in late fees despite paying the loan on time. My payment was due on XX/XX/year>, and I made my payment XXXX XXXX on the same date, yet the website attempted to automatically double my payment in these late fees. 

I understand bank and card processing times but I am unsure how I can be charged late fees before the day even finished. If I had not done my research, I would not have been able to pay my loan payment+fees and would've potentially be put into a situation where I'd have to consider bankruptcy. I tried to manage this situation by applying for an IDR and forbearance, but that's an entire separate complaint. 

IN SUMMARY : I am being charged late-fees before my payment date has even finished, despite having already complained about my payment price and applied for both forbearance and an IDR plan -- but have not had these processed in a timely manner and can not reach their customer service despite devoting days to attempting it.

I wish to address the following concerns : Ongoing Issues with Loan Forgiveness Process : Despite my repeated efforts to contact MOHELA regarding my student loan forgiveness application, I have faced significant delays and have received little to no response. This lack of communication is not only frustrating, but it also violates the Consumer Financial Protection Act ( CFPA ) and the Student Loan Servicing Regulations, which require loan servicers to provide clear, accurate, and timely information regarding federal student loan repayment and forgiveness programs.

Discrepancies in Loan Amounts : Additionally, I recently discovered discrepancies in the total amounts outstanding on my loan after my loans were transferred from XXXX, which is currently involved in a lawsuit. These discrepancies may constitute a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), as it is crucial that the amounts listed by servicers accurately reflect the loan balance and history. As such, the failure to provide a clear and accurate account of my loan balance is causing undue confusion and distress. 

These issues have created significant delays in the processing of my loan forgiveness application and have caused unnecessary stress in an already difficult financial situation. It is unacceptable for a student loan servicer such as MOHELA to exhibit such disregard for its borrowers, particularly when the servicer is entrusted with the management of important and time-sensitive matters like loan forgiveness. 

As MOHELA is required to adhere to federal laws governing student loan servicing, I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate these matters and take appropriate action to ensure that MOHELA complies with all applicable regulations. It is imperative that borrowers like myself are provided with transparent, accurate, and timely information, and that the loan forgiveness process is handled with the efficiency and professionalism expected of an organization managing federal student loan programs.

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

I finally got confirmation of Mohela receiving it via a message on the website, on XX/XX/XXXX saying that they received it on XX/XX/XXXX. I messaged twice over the next month on the Mohela website asking for a status update. Mohela responded on XX/XX/XXXX saying that "" due to the complex nature of my request '' they needed me to call their customer support line. So I called them, waited on hold for hours multiple times, and finally got in touch with someone a few weeks later ( couldn't wait on hold for XXXX hours at a time during the work day ). When I finally talked to someone, they said that my application had an error because my first principal wrote his name on the supervisor line but did not specify his job title, so they needed me to submit it again after he wrote the word "" principal '' on the line. Interest continued to accrue during this time. So I did as they requested. I asked for an update, and about a month later ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) Mohela said they had forwarded my application to "" FSA ( DL ) '' so they could review it and, if I was approved, the amount I would be forgiven would be from them. The message ended "" Further notification will be sent to you if any updated information is received regarding your Forgiveness. '' After waiting over a month, in XX/XX/XXXX I began to ask Mohela via messaging and trying to wait on hold for XXXX hours at a time to ask about my status. I received a message on XX/XX/XXXX saying the same thing as the previous message. All this time, more interest has accrued, about {$500.00} over the amount that is supposed to be forgiven. 
Finally, after XXXX weeks of calling XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and Mohela, waiting on hold, being transferred up to XXXX different times, and being told different things by different agents at XXXX, I finally talked to Mohela on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. In order for this to happen, I waited on hold for XXXX hours and XXXX minutes, then I talked to someone for XXXX minutes, and that person said they were going to have me talk to a XXXX agent and put me on hold. I waited on hold for another XXXX hours and then finally talked to the XXXX agent, who was confused and did not understand why Mohela XXXX showing I was approved for {$5000.00} of forgiveness instead of {$17000.00} worth of forgiveness like it is supposed to be. I asked several questions, she put me on hold for about XXXX minutes. She then told me she was unable to complete the "" escalation process '' but was not sure why. We talked and she suggested I have my principal write a letter with the letterhead on it and the date on it. I asked some more questions and she said the problem could be that the principal I currently work for wrote the word "" present '' for the dates worked for section on the application, which is because I still work for that principal. I asked if the interest could be prorated to a date when I initially turned in my first application, and she said its not possible. So, I have been paying interest while Mohela is failing to process the application and failing to notify me of any problems with the application. The last XXXX messages I submitted on the XX/XX/XXXX have not been answered by Mohela yet, so they would not have notified me of the problem unless I had the phone call that lasted XXXX hours and XXXX minutes.

CFPB closed the complaint despite me feeling that the response from the company was not adequate. 

This does not do anything to address the underlying reason for the complaint in the first time. This is a generic response simply stating they are still working on it. This is the same type of response that led to all of the issues and does not address the incompetence of the company that led to the report in the first place. I want specific answers. 

XXXX. When will my request be processed? 

XXXX. When will I receive my refund? 

XXXX. Why was I given false timelines for processing? 

XXXX. Why after so many inquiries did I finally get told that a whole new process would need to be started? 

Here are the details of the original complaint. Please do not accept a response or close the case until all XXXX of those questions are answered. 

Complaint number : XXXX "" YOUR COMPLAINT I have a student loan through Mohela, which is currently eligible for Public Service XXXX XXXX XXXX From XXXX to XXXX of XXXX, I made XXXX payments during a forbearance period that were not required of me. In XXXX of XXXX, I made a refund request to have the money returned to me, which Mohela let their customers know was available. From XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX of XXXX, I called Mohela customer service multiple times to check on the status of the refund. I received multiple different answers from various employees of Mohela regarding to process for the refund. XXXX of the more recent calls I spoke with a representative that stated the refund would be processed within XXXX business days and that I should receive the refund in that time frame. I then waited the full 90 days and called them back on XX/XX/XXXX. This time, I spoke with a new customer service rep who told me that they needed to escalate the request because it had not yet been approved by Mohela, so therefore was not sent to the XXXX. of XXXX. I inquired about why after several phone calls and reassurances that the request would go through, why this new escalation needed to be done. I explained that over XXXX dollars is not a small sum of money and that I was unhappy with the handling and runaround that I had been getting. I then spoke with a supervisor, XXXX, who then informed me that she needed to start a whole new process to have my account "" rebilled '' so that they requests could even go through. She refused to give me a time frame, and then confirmed that it may take several months, which is well over the initial 90 day time frame. I asked why these requests were so mishandled and she did not give me an answer. She said this needs to be approved by "" upper management ''. However, when asking to speak to someone from this upper management, she told me the best she could do was send an email request which would take several weeks. I then inquired if I was entitled to interest for the untimely handling of money that was rightfully mine given how much predatory interest I already pay on these loans, and she told me no. I explained to her that I was very unhappy with the mishandling of my request, the multiple different answers that I received, and now having to go through multiple new processes to receive a large sum of money that is rightfully mine. I let her know that I think both her and the people that work under her that I had previously spoken too were bad at their jobs given how many wrong answers and quite frankly complete incompetence in performing the right processes to properly refund me. If this is not handled in a timely manner, I will also be planning to take legal action.

02/11/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to formally file a complaint against Nelnet regarding their refusal to return {$10000.00} that I am owed. PLEASE SEE ALL EXHIBITS ATTACHED. Description of each exhibit at end. 

The total loan amount for the XXXX academic year was {$20000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet disbursed {$10000.00} of this loan to the XXXX XXXX XXXX on my behalf for the Fall XXXX semester. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off that full Fall XXXX loan to Nelnet. Specifically, including interest, I paid {$10000.00} to Nelnet toward the Fall XXXX loan. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, I unenrolled from the XXXX XXXX XXXX  and as a result, the university canceled the Fall XXXX loan from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. The funds returned to Nelnet on or about XX/XX/XXXX. 

The {$10000.00} loan disbursed on XX/XX/XXXX, was for the Fall XXXX semester. The remaining {$10000.00} of the full {$20000.00} loan was scheduled for disbursement in XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX XXXX semester. Since I WAS NO LONGER ENROLLED after XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet DID NOT disburse the Spring XXXX loan. Despite this, in an answer to my complaint, Nelnet claimed that the full {$20000.00} loan was disbursed on my behalf, including the XXXX XXXX portion. Nelnet claims the {$10000.00} I paid goes toward the XXXX XXXX loan. However, that can not be true if I am unenrolled and no XXXX XXXX loan was disbursed to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Nelnets claim is incorrect, as I was no longer enrolled, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX  has confirmed in writing that the XXXX XXXX loan was never disbursed. The other half of that total {$20000.00} loan, the XXXX XXXX portion, would never be disbursed because I UNENROLLED from the university. 

Nelnet has not refunded the full {$10000.00} I paid toward the canceled loan. The only refund I have received was a {$110.00} interest refund, which Nelnet processed on XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, Nelnet still has {$10000.00} that is rightfully owed to me. Despite submitting a formal complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, and providing proof of the canceled loan, and providing proof that I am unenrolled, Nelnet has failed to return the {$10000.00} I paid. I have also made numerous attempts to resolve this issue through phone calls, but each time I was given no clear answers or a resolution. During my multiple calls, I was transferred between representatives, received conflicting information, and was not given a timely resolution. 

I respectfully request that Nelnet issue the full refund of {$10000.00} to the original payment method used on XX/XX/XXXX. I also ask that Nelnet take immediate steps to ensure this matter is resolved, as their actions constitute an Unfair and Deceptive Practice under applicable consumer protection laws. Nelnet 's failure to return the funds and their misleading statements about the disbursed loan amount have caused undue hardship. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to a prompt resolution. However, if my money is not returned to me, then I will be seeking legal action.

I am requesting the CFPB to investigate the following : How my personal and financial data was compromised and whether Nelnet failed to adhere to federal data protection requirements. 
Why Nelnet has refused to provide a resolution or take accountability for the mishandling of my personal information. 
Whether I qualify for a full loan discharge due to this violation.

Every month I add {$100.00} to the amount due, which is supposed to be {$280.00}. The overage was credited against the principal of the loan. This worked very well until XX/XX/XXXX. 

That's when a change was made between MOHELA and Studentaid.gov. I'm still not entirely clear on what that change was. But since then, when I add the {$100.00} to each payment, and include a message to MOHELA using their in-house email, "" Apply the overage against principal of my loan, '' -- instead they apply the overage against the next payment.

So I arrive at MOHELA to make my payment and it'll say "" Amount due : {$180.00}. '' I spent *hours* on the phone with them after last month 's payment. I began around XXXX XXXX and wasn't finished until after XXXX XXXX  ET. Their phone service is arduous to get through. I was handed off to 3 different staff members.

The last MOHELA staff member I spoke with, I was told, was a supervisor who had the authority to handle this issue. She asked me to email her office directly with the request that all overage be applied against principal, using her name in the subjectline I believe. I did this.

Last week I received a notice from MOHELA about the upcoming payment due.

I attempted to call more than once so that I could expedite an administrative and/or processing forbearance ( despite requesting one over a month prior ) while my IDR request is still being considered. 

During the first call, the Mohela automated customer service agent couldn't verify my account based on my Social Security number, which I am positive is correct, as I verified more than once. As I had to begin work, I had to give up the attempt at calling. 

The second call was made today, Friday XX/XX/XXXX, the chance at speaking to a human before my next payment was due. My social security number was still unable to be verified, and my account number took XXXX attempts ( once more, I am positive the numbers were correct ). After finally getting past this stage, I was placed on hold for around 2 hours until the company 's business hours were up. 

In summary, I applied for forbearance as I requested an IDR. Over a month later, I have received no meaningful update, and will be forced to make a second payment, leading my total to be over {$800.00}. All attempts to reach Mohela customer service via phone were futile through no fault of my own, but rather the company 's mismanagement of Hold Times and automated systems.

XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

Delay in processing I have been tracking the behavior of Nelnet. Recently, I have scheduled a group of daily payments.

The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions. 
2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Please be advised that this is NOT a refusal to pay but a request sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I am disputing the validity of the alleged debt ( s ), and I am requesting proper validation. 
This is NOT a request for mere verification of my mailing address or other peripheral information, but a formal demand for competent evidence that establishes my legal obligation to pay this debt and the right of your office to report it to consumer reporting agencies. 
Specifically, I request the following : Account Information : Account Name : Dept of Edu/XXXX  Account Number : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX Account Name : Dept of Education/OSLA  SRV Account Number : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Proof of Debt : I respectfully demand that you provide a copy of the original wet-ink promissory note or other documents that serve as the foundation of the alleged debt ( s ) you claim I owe. The absence of such documentation violates my rights under the FCRA, FDCPA, and any applicable state laws. You must provide evidence proving your legal authority to report this debt. 
2. Failure to Provide Proof : Should you be unable to furnish the original promissory note or other valid documentation within 30 days from receipt of this letter, I request that you immediately cease reporting this account to any and all consumer credit reporting agencies and remove it from my credit file. The continued reporting of unsubstantiated debts is a violation of the FCRA and may also constitute fraud. If no response is received within the 30-day window, I will pursue all available legal actions to ensure compliance.

3. Correction of Consumer Report : If your office decides to remove the accounts from my report, I request written confirmation of this removal, along with written verification from the credit bureaus that the accounts have been deleted.

Further, this letter serves as a Formal Notice under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) : The unauthorized disclosure of my student loan-related information to consumer reporting agencies without my written consent may also be a violation of FERPA. I have not provided consent for such disclosure. Therefore, I demand immediate cessation of reporting and removal of all student loan-related accounts from my consumer report.

I expect the following actions within 30 days : Immediate Cease of Reporting : Cease reporting any and all student loan-related information to credit reporting agencies.

Removal of All Accounts : Remove all related student loan accounts from my consumer reports. 
Written Confirmation : Provide written verification from your office and the credit reporting agencies confirming these actions. 
If these requests are not honored within the required time, I will consult with my legal counsel and pursue all legal remedies available to me, including claims under the FDCPA, FCRA, and FERPA. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Failure to comply will result in further legal action.

On XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$1500.00} towards my student loans spread across the 7 loans. This was before interest started accruing. I received a payment confirmation email on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX PM from XXXX. 

After this I thought i was good. I waited until around the next bill was. I thought that was weird that I still had the same balance. I checked the history, and I saw that it was reversed. I was let down because that let a lot of interest accrue. I check my email, and do not see any notification that it was reversed. I did not pay attention to my savings account during this span because I knew I had more than enough to pay. I looked past it, and I paid for XXXX XXXX bill on XX/XX/XXXX - {$250.00} across the XXXX loans. I received another payment confirmation email on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am checking now a month later on XX/XX/XXXX that it was reversed again. I called their support line on XX/XX/XXXX to figure out what was wrong. I gave my information and explained what the issue was, I was put on hold while they were looking into the issue. Later, I was told that it was strange that it was reversed and to call my bank. I asked them to confirm the account number on my account. They said they could not provide that. Understandably, but I realized it would not have been ever activated if that was the case. They said that it could be my bank blocking it. My bank has a stringent alert process, and would've let me know if they blocked a {$1500.00} dollar payment and even a {$250.00} payment. 

I've found many others have been fooled this way, and edifinancial is actually reversing the payments and have lousy notification process on purpose.

They have refused to remedy this and are essentially scamming me out of fraudulent interest charged each month. 

I was previously on the XXXX repayment plan with 0 % interest and no payments required up until the date set by XXXX XXXX on which payments would resume. Prior to this date, I consolidated my loans to take advantage of the "" one time adjustment '' offered by XXXX XXXX 's policies. After the loan consolidation was completed, I was automatically placed back on a "" standard '' payment plan which I can not afford due to being in a low paid training program ( medical residency ). I then applied to be put back on the XXXX plan on XX/XX/year>, which I was on prior to consolidation. While my application was processing, the courts blocked XXXX and so the application has been pending ever since. I was able to submit another application for XXXX on XX/XX/year>. Both are still processing with no updates. 

Initially I was placed on a 0 % interest "" administrative/paperwork processing forbearance '' but after a few months this expired. I called Mohela at that time to request it be extended until my XXXX applications were done processing, but they said my only option was a "" voluntary forbearance '' ( which does NOT count towards XXXX months and also DOES accrue interest ) so this is what I'm currently on. I am asking for your help to get me back on a 0 % interest administrative forbearance until these payment plan applications finish processing, as the loan servicer is now fraudulently applying interest each month to my loans due to forcing me into the incorrect "" voluntary forbearance ''.

01/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Dear CFPB, I am a student loan borrower, who consolidated my loans by the deadline established by the federal government of XX/XX/year>. I also submitted by XXXX  plan application by the deadline. Upon the court 's blocking of the XXXX plan, the federal government allowed all student loan borrowers who consolidated their loans under the federal program, and who submitted application for XXXX is being processed- the government allowed us interest free forbearance. I confirmed this by writing to XXXX, who confirmed that they directed all loan servicers to put borrowers in my situation on interest free forbearance. 
Mohela on its own without my consent decided to put me on a standard 10 year repayment plan with an XXXX monthly payment. As an unemployed newly graduate I was not in the position to make such a large payment. Mohela told me that since XXXX was blocked, they automatically put me on the 10 year standard repayment plan. I mentioned to them about the Processing interest free forbearance due to my save plan application being pending and they misled me by telling me my only option was "" admin forbearance '' with interest accruing and that I would have to call every two months to request and process it. So from XXXX to XXXX I had to continue calling every two months until one day, I received a letter from Mohela saying because my XXXX application is being processed, my loans are now in Interest Free forbearance on XX/XX/year>. However, on XX/XX/year> I received another letter from Mohela stating the total opposite where my loans are now in admin forbearance with interest added. I called in Mohela who deflected my inquires and bounced me around 3-4 reps during which I spent 3-4 hours one day and another 5-6 hours waiting on hold the next day. When I finally spoke with a supervisor from Mohela they confirmed that there was an error on their part and I was correct. The Mohela supervisor told me that she filed a ticket to fix this issue and back date my forbearance to be interest free. She assured me that this would fix the issue and I would not have to take any further steps. Later in XXXX I received a past due notice and again I called Mohela back and once again once I got to the supervisor she confirmed that I was right and was not sure why the request from the previous supervisor was not processed. The supervisor XXXX XXXX told me that this ticket she filed to in regard to the last request from XXXX being processed should fix the issue. She told me that in case it does not I can call back and request her by asking for supervisor XXXX ext XXXX. This request was supposed to be processed in 4-5 business days. It is now the end of XXXX and now my account is showing as 2 months past due. I tried calling Mohela to request for XXXX XXXX the supervisor at ext XXXX and after a 4 hour hold, the representative told me she could not transfer and I would have to wait in a que of another 4-5 hours. It was now the end of business, and I could not afford to continue to wait on hold days after days for the same request, while Mohela continued to mislead me, and continues to mismanage my loans. Mohela has been sued for these call deflecting tactics, so this is nothing new for them. As of now, after filling a request to fix the forbearance issue and back date it to be interest free in XXXX, and XXXX, It still has not been processed. My account is showing as 2 months past due as of now, and in XXXX unless the issue is resolved on Mohela end it will be 90 days past due, even though It should have been in interest free forbearance because my save application is still pending.

Right before XXXX the area news was there and students were protesting about allegations of accreditation and lending issues. Me and other classmates were worried so we asked teachers and principal about what's going on and they told us that it's nothing we should worry about and that we are fine. We were weeks before XXXX and red flags was starting already. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX. A couple months later the school had completely closed. Next thing you know I was getting contacted by law offices asking did I want to join multi class suits with other students. I consulted with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX guaranteed job placement after XXXX and I heard nothing from them at all after XXXX. So after being unemployed for months I had to contact Sallie Mae about forbearance but that only lasted for a short period of time. Next thing you know Sallie Mae gave our loans to Navient school loans. By then the loans were collecting interest because XXXX XXXX had me to sign for a subsidized, unsubsidized, private loans totaling about {$24000.00} at the time. I was continuously was searching for employment but could find anything in my field. I was XXXX XXXX XXXX with a XXXX XXXX daughter and starting suffering major financial hardships. I kept up with necessary paperwork for loan providers. I found a job but it was paying a little over minimum wage at the time. I could barely pay rent or anything due to being unemployed for so long after XXXX. So in XXXX my child and I relocated to XXXXXXXX with my mom and stepdad. By then the interest accrued so bad I had to get my loans consolidated not knowing that it made my loans reached almost {$55000.00}. I was still being contacted by Navient to pay loans and redo payment plan. After years of doing forbearance Navient finally offered income contingent plan for repayment. 
Since I had low income I didn't have to pay anything until I made moderate income to even pay. I constantly was contacting the school and Attorney General XXXX XXXX about help with school loans discharged but they still had a ongoing case and it was summer XXXX and it was almost time to redo payment plan papers again. XXXX XXXX hit and I redid my in XXXXXXXX payment plan again. XX/XX/XXXX I filed my taxes not knowing anything at all about my file was placement for default through the Department of Education at all. Then while waiting on taxes I get a letter from them saying I'm in default and my entire income tax of {$9700.00} was sent to Department of Education for loans. 
Then I was sent a letter from Navient that I was going through garnishment of wages because the income contingent papers I had sent wasn't finished because it was missing a signature. 
Navient failed to even help or notify me of default or garnishment at all. My credit then dropped from about XXXX to negative XXXX. I was devastated completely. I had to contact XXXXXXXX XXXX and pay them for credit repair for a year. Then also make on time payment for a year through Navient to get out of default. Spring XXXX approached and I made it out of default and credit went up but I was still struggling living with my parents. I kept trying to contact Attorney general in XXXX but they sent a paper saying to explain my situation. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. My life has been traumatized by debt collector from school loans, credit being bad reported, and having severe financial hardships. My loans were recently placed with XXXX XXXX and I applied for Borrowers Discharge in XXXX but I'm still held to a repayment agreement through them. I recently found out that XXXX XXXX, SALLIE MAE, NAVIENT LAWSUIT WAS FOUND GUILTY OF PREDATORY LENDING, OVERCHARGING STUDENTS, AND ACCREDITATION ISSUES. ALSO DISCHARGE OF LOANS, RESTITUTION, AND CREDIT REPORTING WAS GIVING OUT BUT IM CURRENTLY STILL IN THE POSITION. I HAVE CONTACTED BUSINESS FOR HELP LIKE XXXXXXXX XXXX FOR HELP.

"" Borrowers may apply for IDR plans and/or to consolidate loans by using the online applications for Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Application Alternatively, borrowers continue to have the option of submitting a paper application by downloading and printing a PDF form.

Borrowers may apply for different income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans depending on their individual circumstances. We encourage borrowers to review the specifics of each IDR plan in order to make the best choices for their circumstances. For example, if a borrower enrolls in an IBR Plan and then moves to a different repayment plan, accrued and unpaid interest will capitalize ( be added to the principal balance ). 

Borrowers are still permitted to apply for IDR plans, including SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation.

A summary of each plans current application and enrollment availability is as follows : SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ) : Can apply ; will be placed in forbearance Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) : Can apply Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ) : Can apply. Note : Borrowers who have Direct Consolidation Loans that repaid PLUS loans made to parents can apply only for the ICR Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ) : Can apply Servicers have begun processing certain IDR applications that were paused following court orders affecting the terms and availability of IDR plans.

Specifically, processing has resumed for borrowers applications to enroll in the IBR, ICR, and PAYE Plans. Servicers are also processing recalculations and recertifications for IBR, ICR, and PAYE. Servicers will have applications in the queue that will take some time to work through. Processing for SAVE ( formerly known as REPAYE ) applications and applications where borrowers selected lowest monthly payment will remain paused. Borrowers should check back to this page for future updates. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted an application for IBR via XXXX and because I could not figure out which plan was best for me, selected the option to allow the servicer to select a plan. Nothing happened. The application was still under review. Then information came out that the IDRs would be processed beginning XX/XX/XXXX. In effect, for two months, an application that was properly submitted, MOHELA did nothing with. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed MOHELA to check the status of this XXXXBR application but decided to call on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I sat on hold for 1 hour 39 minutes and 27 seconds waiting for a representative. I was able to speak with XXXX and when asked what the status of the IBR application was that was submitted XX/XX/XXXX, he advised, they only "" recently '' began reviewing applications. When I asked what "" recently '' meant, he advised he could not provide a specific date, but "" last week. '' When I asked why nothing was processed until "" last week, '' he could not provide an explanation. When I stated that it feels as though MOHELA does not care about its customers, he replied that MOHELA does. When I asked him to explain how it is that MOHELA cares, he could not provide an explanation. 

I understand a company does not need to care about its customers. However, it seems to me that it is good overall business practice for a company to in fact care about its customers, to accurately provide information, to timely process applications, and to understand that as a customer, I actually DO want to pay my student loan. The longer I sit in this general forbearance that is ineligible for PSLF credit, the longer I am indebted to the DoE. I know that I am not alone in wanting to pay my student loans and wanting this weight of owing what is essentially a house that I will never live in to be paid off so that one day, I may actually own a house I can live in.

I am frustrated with MOHELAs lack of transparency as to the reasoning for NOT processing applications for IBR for over three months. I am frustrated with MOHELA not taking any appropriate action and processing the applications when submitted. I can not think of a single business where failing to process applications would not be actionable. At the very least, MOHELA could have acknowledged receipt of the IBR application and provided information that they would not be processing or to advise when they began processing. 

I fully understand how a new presidential administration can impact the student loans and the DoE. However, the failure to process applications prior to the elections in XX/XX/XXXX is unacceptable. The failure to process applications beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, when DoE provided information/guidance that servicers would begin processing applications and MOHELAs decision to not comply with this and the failure to communicate why it was not processing applications is unacceptable. MOHELA is keeping me unnecessarily on hold and from making payments that would in fact qualify for PSLF as guaranteed in the Master Promissory notes of ALL of my student loans, so long as I am employed by an employer who qualifies.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,AZ,85021,None,Consent provided,Web,01/29/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11840248

Specifically, XXXXXXXX XXXX misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions. 
2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

01/24/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Subject : Formal Complaint Regarding Wrongful Interest Accrual on Student Loan under the SAVE Plan I am filing a formal complaint regarding wrongful and improper interest accrual on my student loan account, which is serviced by Aidvantage, while I have been enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. This complaint pertains to a charge of {$30.00} in interest that was wrongfully applied to my account, despite the provisions of the SAVE Plan, which clearly state that interest should not accrue during this period of {$0.00} payments.

Summary of the Complaint : 1. Interest Accrued Despite Eligibility for {$0.00} Payments On XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that {$30.00} in interest had been charged to my account. As per the terms of the SAVE Plan, I am eligible for XXXX XXXX monthly payments due to my income. The SAVE Plan explicitly guarantees that borrowers will not accrue interest while making {$0.00} payments. This is a key provision of the plan, which is meant to prevent the accumulation of unnecessary debt for borrowers. Therefore, the interest accrual on my account is a clear violation of the terms outlined in the SAVE Plan and federal guidelines governing student loans. 


2. Misleading and Inadequate Response from Aidvantage Shortly after discovering the erroneous interest charge, I contacted Aidvantage, my loan servicer. I spoke with a representative who assured me that the interest would be removed from my account. However, despite this assurance, the {$30.00} in interest has not been removed. I also spoke with a supervisor in XX/XX/XXXX, who was unable to explain the source of the interest charge. The supervisor acknowledged the issue but could not provide a reasonable or reliable explanation for why the charge was applied. Furthermore, the supervisor promised to follow up with additional information but never called back, leaving me without any resolution. 


XXXX. Press Release by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  In response to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX siding in favor of a lawsuit led by XXXX attorney general and five other Republican-led states, which argued the Department of Education lacks the authority to carry out the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a press release on XX/XX/XXXX that, "" The XXXX XXXX borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance. '' This statement confirms that borrowers in the SAVE Plan were not supposed to have any interest accrue during this period. Therefore, the interest charge applied to my account violates both the intent and provisions of the SAVE Plan.

4. Violation of the SAVE Plans Interest Waiver Provisions The SAVE Plan explicitly states that borrowers making {$0.00} payments will not have interest accrue on their loans. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Education, along with XXXX XXXX XXXX, confirmed that no interest should be accruing during this period for borrowers enrolled in the program. This was further reinforced by a temporary interest-free forbearance granted to all eligible borrowers during the XXXX period. Despite these protections, interest was still erroneously applied to my account, which directly contradicts the terms of the program. 


5. Federal Protections and Legal Violations Aidvantages actions may be in violation of several federal laws and regulations, including : The Higher Education Act of XXXX : This law governs federal student loans and outlines the rights of borrowers, including protections against wrongful interest accrual. 

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) : This act prohibits unfair practices related to debt collection, including the improper charging of interest.

The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) : This act mandates accurate and transparent disclosure of loan terms and conditions, including the proper application of interest rates.

The wrongful application of interest and failure to provide proper documentation regarding the charges is a violation of my rights as a borrower and constitutes improper loan servicing practices. 


XXXX. Lack of Transparency and Accountability To date, Aidvantage has failed to provide adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the interest charge. When I requested clarification, they could not provide reliable information or a satisfactory resolution. Their failure to follow up on the promised call-back has left me in a state of uncertainty and concern regarding the accuracy of my loan servicing. This lack of transparency is not only frustrating but also indicative of improper bookkeeping and potentially unlawful practices.

Requested Resolution : 1. Immediate Refund of the {$30.00} in Interest : Refund the amount of {$30.00} that was incorrectly charged to my account, as the SAVE Plan explicitly states that interest should not have accrued. 


XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX : XXXX a thorough review of my loan account from XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX to ensure that no additional improper interest has been charged. If further interest charges are identified, I request that they be refunded promptly.

3. Refund of Any Payments Made Toward Improper Interest : Any payments I have made towards the erroneously applied interest, I request that these funds be refunded in full.

4. Written Explanation of Interest Charges : Provide a detailed, written explanation outlining the origin of the interest charges, specifically addressing the {$30.00} that was applied while I was enrolled in the SAVE Plan. 


XXXX. Confirmation of Corrective Actions : Ensure that Aidvantage takes corrective actions to prevent the reoccurrence of this issue for other borrowers and provides me with a formal assurance that this matter has been rectified on my account. 



Conclusion : I believe that the actions taken by Aidvantage are in direct violation of federal regulations, the SAVE Plans provisions, and my rights as a borrower. I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take immediate action to resolve this issue and ensure that I am refunded the incorrect interest charges and that my loan balance is corrected. 

Additionally, if this matter is not resolved within a reasonable timeframe, I will be pursuing legal action and exploring other avenues to hold Aidvantage accountable for their failure to comply with federal student loan policies and the rights of borrowers like myself. 

Please let me know if any additional information or documentation is required to support this complaint.

As a federal student loan borrower, I am deeply concerned about the potential risks of identity theft, financial fraud, and long-term consequences resulting from this breach. 

Given the severity of this violation and its impact on borrowers like myself, I request immediate action to remedy this situation.

At the very least, I request that all collections and interest accrual be halted while this matter is investigated. 

I would appreciate a prompt response outlining the steps your office is taking to address this issue and any available options for affected borrowers. Please advise on how I can further protect my financial interests given this breach.

According to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, borrowers who were enrolled in XXXX were placed into a general forbearance which would not count toward XXXX or XXXX  forgiveness. However, time spent in a processing forbearance ( a category Mohela should have already applied in my case ) does count toward XXXX, provided the borrower is in an eligible employment status ( I am employed by the XXXX ).

I attempted to explain that based on the guidelines references above, I should have been moved into a processing forbearance.

Mohela 's phone tree system seems specifically designed to block XXXX candidates from reaching a live rep. I was placed in an endless loop and had to lie on the phone tree to speak to customer service.

I request immediate clarification and correction of my forbearance status ( from XXXX to processing forbearance ) in line with the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX rules, retroactive to XX/XX/year>.

Despite the significant time that has elapsed, I have yet to receive any substantive response from Mohela, and it appears they are intentionally stalling the processing of my application. 

Each time I contact Mohela, I am placed on hold for over XXXX hours, only to be subjected to a series of inconsistent responses. On several occasions, Mohela representatives have confirmed the receipt of my application, only to later claim that they can not locate it. This back-and-forth has left me frustrated and without any clear resolution. 

Additionally, Mohela has been deflecting responsibility, instructing me to contact various other agencies, including XXXX and XXXX XXXX, without providing any concrete solutions. They have asserted that the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the institution in question, is not marked as closed in their system. However, when I contacted XXXX, it was confirmed that the college is indeed closed. This discrepancy suggests a significant lapse in Mohela 's internal systems and coordination. 

The lack of accountability and the continuous redirection between Mohela and other agencies have made it impossible for me to move forward with my application. This situation has not only delayed the process but has also caused unnecessary stress and confusion. 

I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter thoroughly and hold Mohela accountable for their inadequate handling of loan discharge applications. Borrowers should not be left in limbo, especially when they are following the required procedures and seeking the assistance they are entitled to.

I currently carry a balance exceeding {$50000.00} in federal student debt. 

Recently, I have become deeply concerned that my data, including personal identifiers and financial details connected to my student loan account, may have been compromised, accessed, or mishandled by unauthorized partiesspecifically XXXX XXXX and/or individuals or entities affiliated with him. 

Given XXXX XXXX extensive influence across multiple technology platforms, including his ownership and control over XXXX  ( formerly XXXX ), and his widely reported access to user data, I fear that he or associated parties could have improperly accessed or mishandled my federally protected borrower data. 

This concern is particularly alarming because XXXX XXXX is a private citizen and a nationalized individual from XXXX XXXX, raising additional worries regarding the potential foreign exposure of sensitive U.S. borrower data.

Specific Concerns : Unauthorized access to my personally identifiable information ( PII ) and federal loan records. 
Potential misuse or dissemination of my financial data by foreign or non-governmental entities. 
Emotional distress and ongoing uncertainty about my financial privacy and security. 
While I am not aware of a publicly disclosed breach involving federal borrower data, the pervasive data-sharing practices within large technology corporations under XXXX XXXX ownershipcoupled with his non-U.S. national backgroundhave led me to believe that my information could have been accessed without my consent. 

The possibility of my sensitive financial records being in the possession of non-governmental and potentially foreign entities is deeply distressing and unacceptable. 

Requested Resolution : In light of the serious nature of my privacy concerns, I am requesting the following actions : A formal investigation into whether my federal student loan data has been accessed, compromised, or shared with XXXX XXXX or individuals/entities affiliated with him. 
Verification and assurance that my borrower data remains secure and has not been subject to unauthorized access.

Loan forgiveness or significant reduction as a compensatory measure due to the emotional distress, privacy risk, and potential exposure of my financial information. 
Enhanced safeguards and disclosure transparency regarding third-party access to borrower data, ensuring that non-U.S. citizens or private individuals can not exploit or obtain such information. 
I am seeking prompt action on this matter, as the uncertainty surrounding the security of my financial information places me under continuous emotional and financial strain. I trust that you will treat this matter with the gravity it warrants and provide the necessary remedies. 

Thank you for your attention and swift response.

Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations XXXX XXXX XXXX Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : XXXX. Approve all outstanding XXXX XXXX applications for students who attended these institutions. 
XXXX. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

I have at least 120 months of approved qualifying employment, and I am seeking PSLF or TEPSLF discharge through PSLF buyback. I submitted a PSLF employer certification form on XX/XX/XXXX which was processed on XX/XX/XXXX and my payments were subsequently updated on the FSA website to XXXX eligible/qualifying payment counts. However, I made my final three payments in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, specifically on the dates of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, I am currently caught up in the SAVE forbearance and understand that payments made during the forbearance period typically do not count toward PSLF, however these final three payments that I made if counted would bring me to 120 payments exactly which would allow me to achieve forgiveness now. This would be achieved through buyback. I also submitted an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Application on XX/XX/XXXX to switch from SAVE to PAYE as I'm not currently getting any PSLF credit due to being in SAVE forbearance. I did this just in case my buyback request is denied. My IDR Application is still under review. If my PSLF Reconsideration Buyback request is denied and I have to make three additional payments under PAYE, I am completely fine with that but shouldn't have to make any additional payments. I just want to be done and obtain student loan forgiveness/discharge as soon as possible. I would like for MOHELA, FSA and/or the Department of Education ( DOE ) to please review, process and approve my PSLF Reconsideration Buyback Request so that my account can finally be updated to 120 payments resulting in student loan forgiveness/discharge.

02/05/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"To whom it may concern : I am filing a formal complaint regarding improper interest accrual on my student loan account, serviced by Mohela, while I was in forbearance after applying for the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. This complaint concerns {$2700.00}, which was applied to my account despite the Department of Educations directive that forbearance shall not accrue after sixty days of processing. 

Summary of the Complaint : 1. Improper Interest Accrual Despite Administrative Forbearance : I discovered on XX/XX/XXXX that interest had accrued on my account. I had applied for the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX, which would have $ XXXX  monthly payment amount per Federal Student Aid. 
2. Inadequate Response from Loan Servicer : Shortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted Mohela. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. 
3. Directive from Department of Education : The Department of Education website, updated on XX/XX/XXXX, states : If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. Despite this guarantee, interest has continued to accrue on my account. 
4. Violation of Federal Protections : These actions may violate federal laws and regulations, including : o The Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs student loans and protects borrowers rights. 
o The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits unfair debt practices. 
o The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which ensures accurate loan terms disclosure. 
5. Lack of Transparency : Mohela has not provided adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the improper interest charges, leaving me without a resolution. 

Requested Resolution : I respectfully request the following : 1. Immediate Refund of Improperly Charged Interest : Refund charged to my account 2. Adjustment of Interest Rate : Apply 0 % interest rate to my account until SAVE plan litigation is resolved. 
3. Review of Loan Account : Conduct a full review of my account to ensure no additional improper charges.

4. Detailed Explanation : Provide a written explanation of the interest charges and their origin.

5. Preventative Measures : Ensure corrective actions to prevent similar issues for other borrowers. 

Conclusion : I believe Mohelas actions violate federal regulations and borrower protections. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue legal action and explore other avenues to ensure compliance with the SAVE Plan and federal guidelines. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

I am very grateful for the programs and initiatives that have been implemented by the Department of Education to provide relief for student loan borrowers. I have began educating myself on the various options available for forgiveness and I believe I meet the criteria for eligibility under the Borrowers Defense program. 
Unfortunately I recently discovered that my loan servicer Navient failed to properly handle my student loans and neglected to consider my eligibility for loan forgiveness despite meeting the criteria. Navient did not provide me with the necessary information, guidance, or assistance needed in pursuing forgiveness options. The mishandling of my loans has caused very significant financial distress and has hindered my ability to achieve financial stability. As a responsible borrower I have fulfilled all obligations required of me. It is very disheartening to realize that my loan servicer 's negligence has resulted in preventing me access to benefits that I am rightfully entitled to. In addition to Navients negligence in assistance with loan forgiveness the servicer has also been extremely negligent in communicating loan terms as well as transfers, this is in addition to the predatory lending practices the servicer has participating in while servicing mine an countless other borrow loans. I am kindly requesting the Department of Education conduct a thorough investigation into this mater and take any and all appropriate action against my loan servicer for their mishandling of my student loans. Additionally, I urge you to please rectify this situation by ensuring that my eligibility for loan forgiveness, as well as any correspondence with my loan servicer that supports my claims. I am more than willing to provide any further information or documentation required to support my case. I trust that the Department of Education will take this matter seriously and address it promptly.

01/13/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","On XX/XX/year>, I applied for loan consolidation and an income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) plan through MOHELA, intending to pursue Public Service XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Despite submitting my application promptly, MOHELA did not respond for several months, causing significant delays. On XX/XX/year>, I was informed that my loans had been placed into forbearance. This delay, which lasted over XXXX months, was not caused by me but resulted in significant financial repercussions. 

During the extended processing period, my loans accrued interest. As a first-year resident with a limited salary, I planned to make affordable payments under an XXXX plan. However, MOHELAs delays prevented me from doing so. This is particularly concerning because my future payments under an IDR plan will likely be higher due to anticipated increases in income after completing my residency. The delay has disrupted my financial planning and undermined my efforts to manage my debt responsibly. 

Furthermore, MOHELA placed my loans in processing forbearance rather than administrative forbearance. This distinction is critical because processing forbearance allowed interest to accrue, increasing my loan balance through no fault of my own. Since I was not given the option to make payments during this period, it is unfair that interest accumulated. This practice feels misleading and exacerbates the already significant financial burden of medical training.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,NJ,076XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/13/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11487007

01/22/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","I graduated from XXXX XXXX in 1997, which is XXXX  years ago, and despite my best efforts to meet my loan obligations, I have been unable to repay my student loans in full. Over the past XXXX  years, I have encountered multiple life challenges that have made it extremely difficult for me to maintain regular payments My financial situation became particularly strained when I had to file for bankruptcy and then my ex-husband was incarcerated. As the sole provider for my family during that time, I was faced with the heavy responsibility of supporting my children and myself. Despite working multiple jobs, including pursuing a career in teaching, the compensation was insufficient to cover both my living expenses and my student loan payments. As a result, I was forced to explore alternative job paths in order to provide for my family, but unfortunately, these jobs did not offer enough financial stability to allow me to continue paying off my loans. 

In addition to the hardship of being a single provider, I have struggled with the long term consequences of the economic turndown and rising living cost, sending children to school, which have further impeded my ability to meet financial obligations. While I have worked diligently to manage my finances and pay off my student loans, the burden has been overwhelming. 

Given my long history of financial struggles, coupled with my sincere commitment to rebuilding my financial future, I am requesting loan forgiveness or relief under any hardship programs. I am hopeful that with your support I can begin a new chapter of financial freedom, as I am committed to improving my situation and achieving greater financial stability in the future. 

I, thank you for your time and consideration of my request. I look forward to your understanding and hope for a favorable resolution to my case.

01/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"Hello, Thank you for reviewing my complaint and providing support in hopefully reaching resolution. I have submitted at least 2 requests to Mohela ( upploading the appropriate forms ) for a 12 month deferrment as I work to resolve a financial hardship. Each request has been met with no confirmation of approval, only a response stating "" please allow up to 90 days for processing your request '' however, I never receive confirmation it in fact has been processed ( approved ). The first request was in XX/XX/year> and the second request may have been in XXXX ( I am not certain ). A forebearance of 2 months was issued however, it was unrelated to my request of 12 months and was an Administrative Forebearance. I understand through my research that in XX/XX/year>, Moehla was sued for a wide range of unlawful practices including illegally denying service to borrowers that need help. The only communication I receive from Mohela, is notification of a past due payment. I understand repayment is my responsibility and I have only requested a 12 month forebearnce. Additionally, documents I have sent to them appear listed in their Inbox only to dissappear several weeks later. I am in desperate need for assistance. Attempts to contact them by phone have been futile as the wait time to speak to a customer service representative often exceeds one hour. Messages sent to them using their Message Center still do not provide me with the forebearance approval I am seeking and do little to answer the questions posed to them. If you notice, the "" Documents Sent to Me '' list is quite extensive however, documents I sent to them have been deleted. Again, I sincerly appreciate your time and consideration. Thank you.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CA,92563,None,Consent provided,Web,01/07/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11410574

I submitted the required information and signatures of the six churches I served. My application was consolidated somehow and some confusion about one of the churches was evidently resolved and it all went to XXXX. which has sent me a statement every month since. Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX they show XXXX payments. So for months I assumed I was good to go. 
Recently PSLF showed a new format where I can go to a page that shows my activities. On that page it shows one church, XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, once as complete and once under review. It omits another XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX 's. I had XXXX online "" chats '', the first two of which were ridiculous. One suggested I begin the whole application from the beginning. Another thought I might need to try another computer. The third said the name of the church doesn't matter as long as the EIN is correct and concluded the chat. But I was worried about the EIN and went back online to check EINs. I couldn't do that, but discovered a subsequent page which showed all XXXX churches I have served as complete. However they show XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, as rejected as of last XXXX for no apparent reason. I was never notified about this, and the two churches are no different from the other four, except that PSLF shows a little trash can emoji next to them.

01/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Misapplication of Loan Payments and Non-Responsive Customer Service To Whom It May Concern : I am writing to file a formal complaint against Sloan Servicing for the mishandling and misapplication of my student loan payments, which I believe constitutes unethical and potentially illegal practices in violation of federal consumer protection laws. 

Summary of Complaint : Misapplication of Payments : Up until XX/XX/XXXX, Sloan Servicing properly applied my monthly payments to both principal and interest. 

Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, Sloan Servicing stopped applying any portion of my {$560.00} monthly payments to the principal. Instead, 100 % of each payment was applied solely to interest. This continued through XX/XX/XXXX. 

This misapplication persisted despite my consistent, on-time payments. For example : XX/XX/XXXX : {$560.00} {$490.00} applied to principal, {$61.00} to interest. 

XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : {$560.00} payments {$0.00} to principal, {$560.00} entirely to interest. 

Lack of Resolution and Follow-Up : I have contacted Sloan Servicing multiple times regarding this issue. Each time, customer service assured me that the matter would be escalated to a XXXX. Despite these assurances, I never received any follow-up communication or resolution. 

History of Timely Payments : I have never missed or been late on any payment. My payment history reflects consistent, timely payments through auto-debit, emphasizing the seriousness of this misapplication issue. 

Prior Large Principal Payment : On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a {$10000.00} payment, with {$10000.00} explicitly applied to principal. This significant payment was made with the clear intent to reduce my loan balance. The current misapplication undermines this effort and suggests a pattern of negligence or intentional misconduct. 

Potential Violations : XXXX XXXX actions XXXX violate federal laws governing fair loan servicing, including the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 

Their failure to apply payments correctly and refusal to address my concerns demonstrates a lack of transparency and accountability. 

Requested Resolution : Immediate Correction : Apply all misapplied payments since XX/XX/XXXX to the loan principal as originally intended. 

Formal Explanation : Provide a detailed explanation for why my payments were misapplied and why no follow-up occurred after repeated inquiries. 

Preventive Measures : Implement corrective measures to prevent this issue from recurring. 

I am submitting this complaint in the hope that the CFPB will investigate Sloan Servicings practices and hold them accountable for these potential violations.",None,"Nelnet, Inc.",TX,75071,None,Consent provided,Web,01/10/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11466625

I couldnt get any information, history, payments made, or any explanation of why this mess exists. 

I had to look at the data to even get the original amount originating in XXXX. I graduated in XXXX. I enrolled in the XXXX from XXXX to XXXX. The XXXX was {$6100.00}, total : {$16000.00}. The current lender is Nelnet. The current bill is {$220000.00} at 8.25 %. 

Nelnet had no previous history, so I had to go to the Dept of Ed. I saw 15 loans from 8 different lenders ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, etc. ).

I had made this request with XXXX and also filed a CFPB Complaint to help with XXXX ( since closed due to transfer ) and a congressional inquiry with my Senator ( XXXX XXXX ) who hand have XXXX XXXX on all my correspondence with EdFinancial and has had the case open prior to the loan balance being transferred. This issue has not been resolved and I am asking that my total loan amount be adjusted to reflect the total loan balance ( including principal and interest ) reflected on my XXXX account. 

I am reaching out because EdFinancial has been unable to address my issue despite continually following up. My loan balance of {$170000.00} on XXXX has inexplicitly increased to {$180000.00} today. No explanation or justification has been provided by EdFinancial for as to why my balance increased so significantly in such a short period of time. It is very frustrating that XXXX repeatedly appears to avoid addressing my complaint for almost 8 months now. I pray this can be addressed timely. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to EdFinancial because my loan balance still was not accurate. This is what I said in an email ( also attached ) : "" I have outstanding inquiries with XXXX and Dept of Ed relating to checking my service account that remain unresolved and need to be addressed. Notably, I do not believe my monthly loan amount is correct because my total loan balance is not accurate. This number is about {$10000.00} more than the total loan amount plus interest balance reflected in my XXXX account.

'' On XX/XX/XXXX I got the following NON-response "" Thank you for contacting Edfinancial Services. We hope this information finds you well. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, we recommend resubmitting your outstanding inquiries with Edfinancial so that we can ensure they are addressed. We look forward to assisting you to resolve these issues. 
XXXX Edfinancial Services '' On XX/XX/XXXX I again restated my issue in creater details providing specific information. In this correspondence I said, "" Sent : Thu XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Eastern Daylight Time ) To : XXXX Subject : Re : Billing Questions? WI XXXX or EdFinancial Services Customer Service, Today I received a letter Edfinancial Services dated XX/XX/XXXX for acct # XXXX Concerningly, the amounts indicated on this letter from EdFinancial are not accurate. These amounts directly contradict total loan balance including principal and interest with XXXX. As previously indicated, a raised concern with a sudden significant interest in my loan balance by XXXX, however this concern was not addressed with XXXX and ignored for months. My total XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX balance including principal and interest is {$170000.00}. The letter I received dated XX/XX/XXXX increases this total loan amount including principal and interest to the tune of over {$10000.00}! Please fix this error. 

Specifically, the correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX from EdFinancial Services indicates that my loan Principal Balance is {$170000.00} and that my "" unpaid interest to be capitalized is {$10000.00} and that my interest not capitalized is {$180000.00} I have provided a screenshot and printouts of my student loan account with XXXX from XXXX and correspondence with XXXX demonstrating that my total loan balance including principal and interest is {$170000.00}. 

Apologies for the delay. I am awaiting a response from Department of Education who has not provided the complete information necessary to meet your request or responded at all. Please see XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Request.pdf attached from XX/XX/XXXX which reflects the most recent communication on this request that remains outstanding. I have also provided notes following my last attempt to speak with my loan servicer to get my issue resolved, it's the word document attached with the XXXX title but reflects my follow up correspondence with the ombuds. I am awaiting my case details that i have requested received by their office on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Is it possible to make a request for you to do this for me? I have attempted to get this information together and made a request for necessary information from the Department of Education who has not responded to this request yet or even acknowledged that they had received this request made through the Office of Inspector General.

This has been incredibly frustrating and I haven't been able to get any answers or clarity on my outstanding issues. I want to make sure that everything that I have raised and that has been well documented is addressed fully and not missed. I do not believe I should be responsible for repeating myself. I can help provide some clarity and direction and some documents that may be helpful to you. I have attached these documents to this email. I have way too many documents to be able to attach here though due to size constraints, and some of the information I do not feel comfortable sharing over email. However, all of this information has been provided to Federal Student Aid and/or XXXX so you should be able to get it from them. If you need me to be the person making the request for that information, please let me know. I would appreciate assistance making that request. I look forward to a prompt resolution to this long outstanding issue. Sincerely, XXXX '' I spoke with a representative who indicated they are doing an account review and would get back to me. During this call the customer service representative indicated they would give me a call back. XXXX from Edfinancial Services replied : "" Hello Xxxxx Thank you for contacting Edfinancial Services. I show, per the notes on your account, that you have spoken to a representative more recently than this e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX. As a friendly reminder, a request was sent to the appropriate department for further review. Please allow time for review and we will notify you if anything else is needed. Thank you, XXXX Edfinancial Services. 

I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX due to no response : "" EdFinancial Services, A friendly reminder that I have been expecting a call back from a representative for over XXXX week, since XXXX. I feel that I am being ignored and that my inquiry is not being taken seriously. I am disappointed and frustrated that it does not appear you have attempted to follow up with me since this email. I pray you can do better than this. When can I expect a meaningful response? 
Sincerely, XXXX '' On XX/XX/XXXX I followed up because I have not received any response. In a phone conversation I was advised that a possible explanation for my balance having changed was incorrect. Ed Financial explained that they had noticed an error in my account balance because interest incorrectly was applied to my account. However, this still does not account for the nearly {$10000.00} unaccounted for discrepancy in my student loans balance. I explained that it was a mathmatical impossibility and went through the math with the representative on the phone. They indicated they still couldn't help me because their "" calculator wasn't working '' on their computer so they referred me to their XXXX Department I followed up in an email at XXXX that day and Jahmelia XXXX XXXX ( presumably accounting ) followed up on XX/XX/XXXX : "" From : Sent : Thu XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) To : XXXX XXXX : Re : Billing Questions? WI XXXX update on my loans, but still appears there is some work to be done. It was discovered about XXXX interest on my loans capitalized when it should not have and my balance has been adjusted. However, there still is discrepancy in my total loan balance that is not accounted for. The balance on my Edfinancial account for my student loans remains incorrect. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called to inquire on my student loans. I spoke with a customer service representative who informed me of a letter that noted that there was an error in my loans that resulted in capitalization of interest that should not have occurred. The balance was adjusted to a principal of XXXX and an interest of {$21000.00}. The letter also apparently says that if this doesnt resolve my issue that I would need to submit a new inquiry and provide additional information. 
I am grateful that a significant error was discovered with how my loans are being serviced, however this does not resolve my issue. There is no mathematical explanation for why my loan amount ( including principal and interest ) increased from {$170000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to what it currently reflects ( including principal and interest ) {$180000.00}. 
We went through my case history and located the information I sent including the photos of my portal reflecting the total principal and interest amount of {$170000.00}. This file is able to be seen by EdFinancial, although at first they were unable to find it. Additionally, they were ale to see my concerns and case notes from when I spoke with Edfinancial, including Edfinancial customer service representative named XXXX back in about the early XXXX timeframe. 
The Edfinancial customer service representative ( XXXX ) advised me that my loan could have capitalized interest since then and that would account for the increase of almost {$13000.00}. XXXX further explained that interest could have capitalized from XXXX until XXXX of XXXX. However, I was on the XXXX plan and making payments. Furthermore, even if the interest fully accrued during this time on my principal balance, this explanation by Edfinancial is mathematically impossible. I was again told that this could be accrued interest and that the letter that was sent to me has resolved my concern. 
I explained that it doesnt resolve my concern and the reason I am being given is mathematically impossible. When I explained that to XXXX, I was told that they are unable to calculate this now because they do not have access to a calculator that can do this math equation. Only once I went through a simplified version of the math equation with XXXX that I learned to do in my XXXX grade required personal finance class they agreed to agree to send my concern to finance so they could do this calculation. 

While not my primary concern, it is alarming to me that I would be provided explanations that are mathematically impossible by customer service representatives to what appears be an attempt to justify what looks very likely to be an incomplete resolution to my issue. I am shocked that customer service representatives are unable to complete a high school level math equation because a software isn't working without escalation to their financial department. 
It has been over 6 months since I sent this information to EdFinancial and this issue remains unresolved. I expect to get a follow up call back from XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX with an update on the status of my concern. 
I look forward to a prompt resolution to this concern. Thank you for your time addressing these issues with my loan service. While significant errors appear to have been discovered and corrected, there still appears to be some serious things wrong with my loan balance that still need to be resolved. '' XXXX said : "" XXXX XXXX, Thank you for contacting Edfinancial Services. After reviewing your account, it concluded that the interest on the account is correct. The daily interest accrual is XXXX per day. There was an interest cap on XX/XX/XXXX that did not include loans XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, So when the interest cap was reversed on XX/XX/XXXX those loans were not included. In addition to that from XXXX, you were in repayment but were not making payments so it had some interest accrual the benefit did not cover. 
Thank you, XXXX XXXX '' I expected a call back from XXXX, who left a note and then I have followed up to EdFinancial with an email on XXXX : "" Thank you for your response. I have been expecting to get a call back from XXXX who I spoke with and did not receive a call. It is unacceptable that I would need to resubmit my claim because of how you choose to mishandle this situation. It obviously is not an issue with the interest rate calculation. Please fix the balance on my student loans. It is incorrect! '' I also called on XXXX and spoke with a customer service representative who reviewed my loan notes and explained that they calculated my interest capitalization and reversal of an interest cap which resulted in a difference of about {$180.00} in error on my loans. Good progress, but there still is over {$10000.00} unaccounted for. The representative noted that interest accrual has been accounted for. 

An explanation XX/XX/XXXX an incorrect interest capitalization was incorrectly applied, but an interest capitalization for other loans were not accurate. This still does not address how my loan principal and balance increased so significantly. 

The Edfinancial supervisor level representative I spoke with was XXXX. I explained that I my issue remains unresolved and that my current student loan balance reported by EdFinancial appears to be incorrect. The total balance plus interest has not increased from XXXX on XXXX to {$180000.00} due to forbearance periods and interest accrual. It is mathematically impossible. My understanding is interest accrual only occurred for a few days in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX indicated that they would request a explanation to correct this. XXXX indicated they would return my call once they had an opportunity to speak with the accounting department so they could provide me an explanation over the phone but that it would "" take a while '' and be "" depending on work schedules. '' This explanation is preferred, but this issue has remained unresolved since XXXX of XXXX with Ed Financial. I have respectfully worked with EdFinancial to address my concern, but need help from CFPB to make sure I have timely and meaningful response to my issue so it can be resolved.",None,EdFinancial Services,WI,548XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/12/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12032723

I have submitted multiple Employment Verification forms, including one dated XX/XX/, to update my qualifying payment count. Despite these efforts, I have not received any correspondence or confirmation. As of now, I have over 120 qualifying payments and need these counts updated to proceed with a buyback of months placed into forbearance by a Texas judge. This situation occurred while I was, and continue to be, enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. 

On XX/XX/, I submitted another Employment Verification Form via both file upload on their website and fax, as advised by their representatives. Despite following their instructions, I have not received any updates. Additionally, I submitted formal complaints through their website twice, as directed by their staff, but no progress has been made. 

This lack of communication and action has left me unable to move forward with resolving my loan situation. I am seeking your assistance to ensure my Employment Verification is processed, my payment count is updated, and I can proceed with the buyback process. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a resolution soon.

Many of us attended the following institutions owned by or affiliated with XXXX, where misrepresentations and predatory practices have been well-documented : * XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Department of Education has XXXX found significant evidence of misconduct by these schools. Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : XXXX. Approve all outstanding XXXX XXXX applications for students who attended these institutions. 
XXXX. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

01/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Subject : Request for Documentation and Proof of Interest Accrual Validity Dear Aidvantage, Thank you for your response regarding the interest accrual on my student loan account. I acknowledge your explanation ; however, I require further clarification and supporting documentation regarding your assertion that my 0 % interest rate eligibility did not begin until XX/XX/ XXXX. 

Given that I was enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan, which explicitly states that interest does not accrue while monthly payments are {$0.00}, I find the reasoning provided in your response insufficient. Furthermore, statements made by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, indicated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE Plan would benefit from an interest-free forbearance during this period. 

I respectfully request documented proof or official guidance that demonstrates why my 0 % interest eligibility under the SAVE Plan did not begin until XX/XX/XXXX. This proof should include : 1XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  guidance or policy outlining the criteria used to determine the delayed start date of my 0 % interest eligibility. 

2. Specific justification as to why my account, which was placed in forbearance starting XXXX XXXX, XXXX, did not qualify for 0 % interest immediately. 

3. Any communication records or documentation sent to me informing me of this delayed eligibility date.

4. Documentation or Official Guidance : Any federal guidelines, court rulings, or instructions from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX explicitly stating that my 0 % interest rate eligibility began on XX/XX/ XXXX, rather than XX/XX/ XXXX. 

5. Detailed Timeline : A clear breakdown of how and when the 0 % interest benefit was applied to my account, including any delays or actions taken by Aidvantage or FSA.

6. Account Records : Copies of all relevant communications or records from Federal Student Aid that directed the implementation of interest accrual on my account. 

It is my understanding that, as a borrower, I have the right to transparent documentation and explanations for any charges applied to my account. Without proof or further clarity, the interest charged during the stated forbearance period remains questionable. 

Please note that I expect a detailed and thorough response, along with all supporting documentation, within 15 business days. Should you fail to provide sufficient evidence, I will consider pursuing additional avenues, including legal action, to ensure compliance with federal student loan regulations and borrower rights. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

02/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I applied for PSLF while working as an XXXX Farm to School Specialist last year, and my student loans ( that have been in repayment since XXXX ) were transferred to MOHELA. Prior, my student loans were serviced with XXXX, and then transferred to XXXX when XXXX went out of business. I have been using my XXXX XXXX XXXX to pay my student loans for about 2 years now, and I had no troubles doing so with XXXX. I always pay my loans a few weeks prior to their due date to ensure processing times do not interfere with paying my loans on time. Since switching to MOHELA, my student loan repayment has been an absolute nightmare. Every single month, they lose my payment, are not applying my payment to my account, are charging me interest for late payments, and are simply not even accepting my payment ( and letting it sit there without taking any action on my payment ) in some cases. I have had to call them every single month in order to have my money tracked down and account rectified and back-dated. On my XXXX  portal where I make payments to MOHELA, I can see if MOHELA has accepted, declined, or has not taken any action ( pending ) on my payment submission. They continuously accept my money, post it for a day prior to my loan due date ( which is the XXXX of every month ) and then I still end up with a notification that my payment is late. I provide receipts and have receipt of every single payment I have made, which has never once been late, and they have to open a case on my account every time to find the money. It usually gets found months later, but this takes hours of my time once a month and it is extremely difficult and frustrating to have to deal with this constantly. I am being penalized by MOHELA, getting interest tacked onto my account, and having my credit score affected when I have done absolutely nothing wrong and have the proof of that. Additionally, none of the customer service representatives are ever able to help me. I have been hung-up on and sent back into the pool of waiting customers seeking help because even when I choose the, "" XXXX '' option from their menu selection upon calling, the customer service representative knows nothing about the XXXX process. I have done my due diligence and worked with XXXX as well when an issue arises each month, and they also confirm with me that this is a MOHELA problem that many customers are experiencing. Something needs to be done about this. This has been an absolutely horrible experience, and I am dealing with it yet again this month regarding my XXXX payments.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,MI,498XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/20/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12152922
01/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I submitted an application for XXXX Student Loan Forgiveness in XXXX, XXXX to MOHELA. I never received confirmation that my application had been received. I called once in XXXX, waited on the phone for four hours, and was asked to call back a month later for a processing timeline. I called in XXXX, waited on the phone for four hours, and was told that the latest they would process my application would be XXXX XXXX 90 days after the application was submitted. They told me to call back in three weeks. I called back in XXXX and XXXX, each time waiting more than four hours to talk to a representative. They ensured me the application would be reviewed by XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, waiting XXXX hours on the phone. They said that my application had not been reviewed and that it might take another few months. The person on the phone said she could expedite the review for me. 


The application was not reviewed until XX/XX/XXXX. The application was rejected because I have worked for multiple school districts. I called three times to follow up. Each time I called, the wait time exceeded four hours. There is no callback option, you have to hold the phone to your ear for four hours. The first customer service representative informed me that I need to have multiple people from multiple districts sign and date the same line, which is impossible. I called again, waited five hours, and was connected to a trainee who said she was not authorized to handle my case. It was too late to transfer me to an authorized representative. I called the next day, and waited five hours to talk to a representative. She informed me that I can submit multiple applications from districts, which I did the next day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my application was reviewed. However, even though I was informed by MOHELA to submit multiple applications, the reviewer only reviewed one of them. They rejected my application on the grounds that I have not taught for five years, when all three applications stated that I have. 

I have called three times to follow up. The first day, I waited six hours. I was connected to a trainee, who put me in another five hour cue to talk to someone with authority. By the time the call was transfered, the center was closed. That was an 11 hour day. I called again yesterday. I waited on the phone for 8 hours, talked to someone who was not authorized to review my case, and was told they were closed for the day and to try again the next day. I called again today. I waited on the phone for five hours, talked to someone who was not authorized to review my case, and was told to wait another 7 hours to talk to an authorized representative. That means they will call me back at XXXX at night, when I called at XXXX. They close at XXXX, there is no chance I will be able to talk to them. 

MOHELA is benefiting from not submitting my application. If the loan is not forgiven, they can keep collecting money from me. It is in their best interest to delay, reject, delay, reject. I have spent more than 50 hours holding my phone to my ear because they do not have a callback option. This can not continue. I need them to review my full application, give valid reasons for approval/denial, and forward my application to the federal government in a timely manner. I waited five months to be rejected because someone did not read my full application. I can not wait any longer. Every month I wait, MOHELA collects another {$350.00} from me in student loan payments.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CA,90815,None,Consent provided,Web,01/28/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11803446

This complaint concerns XXXX, which was applied to my account despite the SAVE Plan 's provisions that guarantee no interest accrual during {$0.00} payment periods. 

Summary of the Complaint : Improper Interest Accrual Despite Eligibility for {$0.00} Payments. Under the SAVE Plan, borrowers eligible for {$0.00} payments should not accrue interest. This interest charge violates the program 's terms, which were implemented to protect borrowers from unnecessary debt accumulation. 

Inadequate Response from Loan Servicer Shortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted Nelnet. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. Additionally, when I spoke with a supervisor, they could not explain the origin of the interest charge and promised a follow-up, which never occurred. 

Press Release by Education Secretary XXXX XXXX In response to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals siding in favor of a lawsuit challenging the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance. Despite this guarantee, interest has continued to accrue on my account. 

Violation of Federal Protections These actions may violate federal laws and regulations, including : The Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs student loans and protects borrowers rights. 

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits unfair debt practices. 

The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which ensures accurate loan terms disclosure. 

Lack of Transparency [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ] has not provided adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the improper interest charges, leaving me without a resolution. 

Requested Resolution : I respectfully request the following : Immediate Refund of Improperly Charged Interest : Refund XXXX charged to my account.

Review of Loan Account : Conduct a full review of my account to ensure no additional improper charges. 

Detailed Explanation : Provide a written explanation of the interest charges and their origin. 

Preventative Measures : Ensure corrective actions to prevent similar issues for other borrowers. 

Conclusion : I believe Nelnet 's actions violate federal regulations and borrower protections. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue legal action and explore other avenues to ensure compliance with the SAVE Plan and federal guidelines. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please contact me if further information is needed.

Each time, I am forced to wait XXXX hours for a callback, only to be told that I need to be transferred to another representative. This transfer results in another XXXX hold, after which the call inevitably drops. Despite these repeated failed attempts, MOHELA has refused to offer a direct callback from the person responsible for handling my issue. 

I also attempted to resolve this matter via email, but they informed me that assistance is only available by phonedespite the fact that their phone system has proven ineffective.The core issue is that MOHELA has been automatically applying my loan payments to my lower-interest loans instead of my older, higher-interest loans. This misallocation has cost me additional interest, and each day that this remains unresolved, I am incurring further financial harm.MOHELAs failure to address my concerns, the excessive hold times, their refusal to provide callbacks, and their lack of alternative resolution methods constitute unfair treatment and grossly inadequate customer service. 

As a federal loan servicer, they have a responsibility to assist borrowers in managing their debt effectively, and their continued inaction is a direct violation of that responsibility.I am requesting the CFPBs intervention to ensure that MOHELA : Immediately reallocates my past payments to my higher-interest loans. 

Provides written confirmation that the correction has been made. 

Ensures that future payments are applied according to my instructions. 

Improves its customer service processes to prevent excessive hold times and the refusal of direct assistance.

01/29/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been calling Mohela and FSA about several years of missing payments in my history. They would blame each other. Now FSA is in charge of the PSLF payment counts. 

The missing time period is XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. That time period doesn't exist for my PSLF counter and my XXXX counter. It should be present for both. Picture attached. 

I was employed by a qualifying employer and made payments to consolidated FFELP loans during that time period. 

I consolidated again to get into PSLF which caused the payment count to reset. That was XXXX. 

The IDR One-Time Payment Adjustment, which was announced in XX/XX/XXXX, was supposed to restore those years of missing payments made with qualifying employer if you loans are currently held by FSA and are consolidated, which my loans are. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) Recently, I resubmitted my ECF forms from that time period and they still aren't counting them. I have a boilerplate statement from them saying those payments don't count because they were FFELP at that time. That document is attached.

However, I was given credit for five months, XXXX when I was previously employed by another qualifying employer and held consolidated FFELP loans at that time ( that picture is attached ). I should have credit for those missing years in my payment history. 

I have filed several complaints ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ) with FSA which go nowhere. I should have been at XXXX at XX/XX/XXXX and my loans should be forgiven. I have working to get this resolved since XXXX. Any help is appreciated.

02/10/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I graduated medical school in XXXX of XXXX with {$150000.00} of federal student loans through MOHELA. Proactively, before I graduated, I attempted to enroll in the SAVE plan XX/XX/XXXX so that I could waive my 6 month grace period and start counting payments towards the XXXX which would qualify me for PSLF loan forgiveness. This application was not processed for unclear reasons and I even attempted to resubmit an IDR plan request XX/XX/XXXX. This was also not processed because allegedly I had to consolidate my loans to "" waive '' my new graduate grace period. Nonetheless, as such, I went ahead and consolidated my loans and timely applied for SAVE. This application has not been processed since early XX/XX/XXXX and I have accrued more than {$1900.00} in interest while working for a recognized underserved area in Florida as a resident physician. According to https : //www.ed.gov/higher-education/manage-your-loans/save-plan, "" If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for PSLF and IDR forgiveness. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. '' My loans have not been processed for XXXX months and have been actively accruing interest. I expressed this to my mohela representative XX/XX/XXXX while experiencing stress about my incoming loan payment of {$950.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX, and she had no idea about this forbearance policy that I quoted directly from ed.gov. Myself and several thousand other new physicians will not be able to pay close to 1,000 or so dollars per month on our resident physician salaries of ~ $ XXXX. In addition, this same representative stated that she could only place my account under administrative forbearance 3 times ( each 60 day periods ) within a 18 month window. I have already exhausted XXXX of my 60 day administrative forbearances. If this is the case, and the injunction and legal proceedings take XXXX months ( which is expected ), I will be ruined financially while working to serve the underserved in XXXX of the counties in XXXX  that have the greatest need for physicians. This would be disastrous for myself and every other resident physician that has graduated with student loans. As such, I would like to file a formal complaint so that myself and thousands of other new physicians can be protected from MOHELA 's negligence and active mishandling/misinformation regarding our student loans. Please help. This subset of XXXX graduates who have not been able to enroll in IBR plans due to mohela 's negligence is experiencing unjust circumstances that need to be investigated. 

This CFPB complaint regarding the above was closed with no tangible impact or help whatsoever. My balance is now {$150000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX with a staggering {$960.00} due amount for XX/XX/XXXX showing that mohela is negligently charging and accruing interest on accounts that are in the midst of processing for the SAVE plan. Mohela has been unable to process this since early XX/XX/XXXX and thus after the XXXX  days of admin processing, I should no longer be accruing interest. My plan is still processing at this time and there should be no reason for a {$960.00} due balance as I should be in a general forbearance per "" If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed.

In addition to that, the SAVE plan is supposed to cover additional interest if the payment is lower than the total interest, which had yet to happen while the payments were active.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 
I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : 1. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ). 
2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 
Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. 
2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose. 
3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations. 
4. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach. 
This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties.

The Bureau found that Edfinancial violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by engaging in deceptive acts and practices. Edfinancial encouraged borrowers to reach out to it for help managing their student loans, and it indicated that it was an expert and could assist borrowers navigating complex student-loan repayment options. FFELP borrowers reasonably relied on Edfinancial to act in their best interests by providing them with complete and accurate information about how to qualify for PSLF and about all the available forgiveness options. Specifically, the company harmed student loan borrowers by : Misrepresenting that FFELP borrowers could not receive PSLF : When borrowers with FFELP loans asked about PSLF, Edfinancial, in many instances, told them they were ineligible, and the company did not tell them they could become eligible by consolidating their loans into Direct Loans and meeting other qualifying requirements. Sometimes, Edfinancial falsely told borrowers their FFELP loans could not be consolidated. These statements, misrepresentations, and omissions created the false impression for borrowers with FFELP loans that they could not obtain PSLF.

Misrepresenting that FFELP borrowers were making payments towards PSLF before loan consolidation : Edfinancial, in both explicit and implicit statements, told borrowers that their payments on FFELP loans would count toward the 10 years of monthly payments required to obtain PSLF. Many borrowers were likely led to believe they were making progress toward PSLF when in fact they were not because they had not consolidated their FFELP loans into Direct Loans.

Misrepresenting to borrowers that certain jobs were not eligible for PSLF : In numerous instances, Edfinancial explicitly stated that certain jobs would not qualify for PSLF when they in fact did. In other instances, Edfinancial failed to include entire job categories, such as non-profit work, when discussing PSLF qualifying jobs. Edfinancials statements likely caused many eligible borrowers to not consider PSLF as a forgiveness possibility.

Describing forgiveness programs to FFELP borrowers without mentioning PSLF : When FFELP borrowers asked about forgiveness options available to them, Edfinancial representatives often described forgiveness options available only for FFELP loans and failed to mention PSLF. The companys statements and omissions created the impression that PSLF was not an option for many FFELP borrowers. FFELP borrowers may have elected not to pursue PSLF because they were either unaware of PSLF or did not think the program applied to them.",None,EdFinancial Services,FL,33313,None,Consent provided,Web,01/31/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11844058

Specifically, XXXX XXXX  misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : XXXX. Approve all outstanding XXXX XXXX applications for students who attended these institutions. 
XXXX. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

The wording in this email was so similar to the generic language included in my monthly billing statement, that I did not realize the document it referenced was a notice about the renewal process and deadline for continuing in IBR. I then received a billing statement for approximately {$2000.00} instead of the approximately {$500.00} I had been paying with IBR, as I had missed the renewal window. When I called Navient in a panic because I could not afford the higher monthly amount, the representative on the phone told me it would be no problem to pause my payments for a month or two so I could reapply for the IBR program. No warnings about the implications about the pause were provided and I agreed and was approved for IBR and back down to my normal payments within 2 months. At no time was I informed I was bring placed in a forbearance that would cause my entire loan balance to by recapitalized, increasing the cost of my loans but more than {$50000.00}. It wasn't until I was reviewing my loan details months later that I realized what had happened. The capitalization has essentially guaranteed that I will never cover more than the interest payments on my loans during the 20 years of payments I'll be making.

I attended classes that week but was later informed that my funds were for the school, not me. The following week, I was withdrawn without my consent and removed from campus. The police were falsely informed that I was never a student. On XX/XX/year>, XXXX XXXX ( Corporate Campus Director ) emailed me, stating my Pell Grant was refunded, showing four transactions : two received, two refunded. However, I never agreed to withdraw, nor was I given an option to use my aid for continued enrollment. 

Additionally : I was billed {$290.00} despite not receiving required materials such as a student U-Pass or textbooksonly printed copies, which were falsely categorized as books. 
The IRS records show two loans were paid off with a {$1700.00} W-2, contradicting the schools claim that my loan was canceled. Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) confirmed my loan was reported as canceled, yet I have documentation proving funds were paid and should have been disbursed to me. 
Instead, the school kept my funds and repaid them in cash, raising concerns of misallocation of federal funds and financial misconduct. 

Violations : Misuse or Misallocation of Federal Funds Pell Grant funds were received but improperly handled. 
Unauthorized Loan Processing or Fraudulent Activity My loan was reportedly canceled, yet records indicate payments were made.

As a borrower, I entrusted MOHELA with the security of my sensitive data, and their failure to protect this information has resulted in a violation of my rights and financial well-being. 

Upon learning of this breach, I have taken necessary steps to safeguard my identity and financial security, including monitoring my credit and reporting the issue to the relevant authorities. However, this breach has caused irreparable harm, and I believe that I should not be held accountable for loans managed by an entity that has failed in its duty to secure my information. 

I request clarification and immediate action on the following : Confirmation of the Breach : Please provide official documentation regarding the extent and impact of the data breach involving my student loan records. 

Dismissal of My Loans : Given the violation of my privacy rights, I request that my loans be dismissed as MOHELA has breached its contractual and ethical obligation to protect borrower information. 

Protective Measures : I seek assurance that further steps will be taken to prevent future breaches and that impacted borrowers are provided with appropriate remedies. 

Legal Justification : If my loans can not be dismissed immediately, I request a detailed explanation, citing federal regulations, as to why borrowers impacted by MOHELAs negligence are still required to repay their loans. 

This breach has caused me significant stress, financial insecurity, and has violated my trust in the federal student loan system. As a borrower, I should not be penalized for the servicers failure to uphold its responsibilities. 

I expect a thorough review of my request and a written response within [ reasonable timeframe, e.g., 14 days ] from the date of this letter. If this matter is not addressed appropriately, I will escalate my concerns to additional regulatory agencies and pursue further legal remedies.

As you may be aware, FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records and ensures that educational institutions maintain the confidentiality of these records, only releasing them under certain conditions. Additionally the Privacy Act of 1974 establishes a code of fair information practices that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies. A system of records is a group of records under the control of an agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifier assigned to the individual.

Specifically, unauthorized access or sharing students records failure to provide written notification of unauthorized access to my confidential information with XXXX XXXX data breaches involving protected student information This incident has caused significant concern, as it undermines the trust and security that is essential in maintaining a safe educational environment. I am requesting an immediate investigation into this matter to ensure that it does not happen again in the future and to assess any potential impacts it may have had on my educational rights.

Given the serious nature of this breach and its impact on my financial standing and potential my personal information be stolen and or breached, I respectfully request that my student loans be dismissed or that my loan status be reviewed for possible cancellation under the grounds of this data breach. My demands are as follows 1. A full review of my situation in light of the FERPA violation to assess how it has impacted my ability to responsibly manage or repay my student loans.

2. Consideration for loan forgiveness or cancellation based on the fact that the violation of my privacy rights were violated 3. Any possible financial relief or remedies that may be available to me due to this incident.

03/09/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I am writing to formally request the discharge of my student loan due to significant documentation deficiencies that have led to financial hardship and emotional distress. 

Under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. ), I am entitled to complete and accurate documentation regarding my loan. However, since XXXX took over my loan in XXXX, I have faced considerable confusion and lack of clarity about my loan status, particularly regarding the transition from XXXX to XXXX and the subsequent claims made by XXXX. The paperwork provided lacks crucial details, including a lender number tied to a mortgage company in Florida and verifiable loan information. 

Moreover, the shutdown of XXXX due to poor loan servicing practices and my unsuccessful attempts to obtain documentation over the past XXXX years only exacerbate my concerns regarding the validity of my loan. My records show no evidence of payments made from XXXX to XXXX, despite having utilized forbearances and deferments. 

# # # Legal Framework and Supporting Case Law 1. **Borrower Defense to Repayment Rule** : Under **34 C.F.R. 685.206**, borrowers are protected when misled by their educational institutions or when there are violations of applicable laws. This rule allows borrowers like myself to seek a discharge of student loans for inadequate documentation or servicer non-compliance with federal regulations. 

2. **Colorado Higher Education Statute ( C.R.S. 23-3.1-2003 ) ** : This statute delineates the responsibilities of higher education institutions and loan servicers to maintain precise and verifiable records. It mandates that loan servicers ensure documentation is up-to-date and readily accessible to borrowers. Failure to follow this statute can provide grounds for loan discharge.

3. **Senate Bill 19-002** : Recently enacted legislation aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability in the student loan servicing process, this bill clarifies that borrowers are entitled to discharge if adequate documentation has not been maintained or provided upon request.

Supporting case law further emphasizes the necessity for clear documentation. For example, in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) **, the court affirmed the need for transparency in loan servicing. 

Given the ongoing emotional and financial burden caused by these issues, coupled with the absence of proper documentation, I respectfully request the immediate discharge of my loan and compensation for the distress experienced. 

As a borrower of federal student loans, I am entitled to certain fundamental rights under federal law, including the right to receive complete, accurate documentation related to my loan. Specifically, under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. ), borrowers are granted significant protections that ensure proper loan servicing and access to accurate information regarding the terms and conditions of their loans. The lack of original documents hampers my ability to understand the specifics of my loan obligations and hinders my rights as a borrower. 

To provide further context, it is important to note that XXXX allegedly took over my loan in XXXX, while XXXX changed its name to XXXX in XXXX and subsequently closed in XXXX. During the period from XXXX to XXXX, I was making payments to XXXX, yet XXXX claims they had my loan and placed their name on the records with XXXX from XXXX before XXXX was involved. Additionally, the paperwork I received from XXXX in XXXX was lacking crucial information, including a lender number associated with a mortgage company based in Florida. There was no specific connection provided to validate my loan, and the consolidating loan information was not clearly included. 

Furthermore, there was a lawsuit that led to the shutdown of XXXX ( formerly known as XXXXXXXX  ) due to poor handling of loans. Despite my attempts to gather appropriate documentation over the past five years, I have not received adequate or legitimate information regarding my loan payments from XXXX to XXXX. My records do not reflect any evidence of payments, which is deeply concerning, especially since my loan was supposed to have a cap of 3 %. I also took out several forbearances and deferments, maximizing those options, but have received no clarity on my loan status or terms. 

The absence of proper documentation raises serious concerns regarding the validity of this loan, leaving me feeling deceived and trapped. The stress and confusion that this lack of clarity has generated are profoundly alarming and unacceptable. As a result, I believe that I am entitled to not only the discharge of this loan but also compensation for the unnecessary distress it has caused me. 

# # # Supporting Case Law Numerous court cases underscore the need for transparency and proper documentation in the loan servicing process : XXXX. *XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ** : This case affirmed the need for accurate documentation in loan servicing and the obligation of servicers to provide clear records to borrowers. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : The court ruled that borrowers have the right to challenge their loans when they do not receive adequate documentation from the servicer. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX Cir. XXXX ) ** : The court determined borrowers could seek loan discharges if the servicer failed to provide necessary documentation. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : This case supported borrowers ' rights to contest their obligations when denied access to essential loan documents. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : The ruling affirmed that borrowers are entitled to rely on their servicers to produce required documentation. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : The court highlighted that servicers must ensure that their records accurately reflect loan terms. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX* : Additionally, in the recent class-action lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) regarding improper documentation and loan servicing practices, it was alleged that borrowers were misled about their repayment obligations. The court found substantial evidence indicating that XXXX failed to comply with federal documentation requirements, similar to the issues I have faced. This case highlights the potential for borrowers like myself to claim discharge on the grounds that servicers compromised our rights through their inadequate practices. 

# # # Personal Impact The experience of navigating this loan has been overwhelming and distressing due to the lack of accurate information. I have made multiple requests for documentation regarding my loan, including payment history, loan terms, and borrower rights, but have not received satisfactory responses. This gap in responsibility has resulted in confusion regarding my repayment obligations and has adversely affected my financial well-being. 

As a borrower of federal student loans, I am entitled to certain fundamental rights under federal law, including the right to receive complete, accurate documentation related to my loan. Specifically, under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. ), borrowers are granted significant protections that ensure proper loan servicing and access to accurate information regarding the terms and conditions of their loans. The lack of original documents hampers my ability to understand the specifics of my loan obligations and hinders my rights as a borrower. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) ** : This case established that educational institutions could be held responsible for misleading information that affects students ' financial decisions. The principle emphasizes that borrowers are entitled to accurate representations regarding their loans. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : While originally about political representation, the ruling emphasized the principle of accountability in compliance with established laws, which can be applied to loan servicers who fail to meet federal and state regulations. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) ** : This bankruptcy case underscores the need for loan servicers to adhere to disclosure requirements and emphasizes borrowers rights if they are misled or inadequately informed. 

To provide further context, it is important to note that XXXX allegedly took over my loan in XXXX, while XXXX changed its name to XXXX in XXXX and subsequently closed in XXXX. During the period from XXXX to XXXX, I was making payments to XXXX, yet XXXX claims they had my loan and placed their name on the records with XXXX from XXXX before XXXX was involved. Additionally, the paperwork I received from XXXX in XXXX was lacking crucial information, including a lender number associated with a mortgage company based in Florida. There was no specific connection provided to validate my loan, and the consolidating loan information was not clearly included. 

Furthermore, there was a lawsuit that led to the shutdown of XXXX ( formerly known as XXXX XXXX due to poor handling of loans. Despite my attempts to gather appropriate documentation over the past XXXX years, I have not received adequate or legitimate information regarding my loan payments from XXXX to XXXX. My records do not reflect any evidence of payments, which is deeply concerning, especially since my loan was supposed to have a cap of 3 %. I also took out several forbearances and deferments, maximizing those options, but have received no clarity on my loan status or terms. 

i would like to reference the Borrower Defense to Repayment rule, codified under 34 C.F.R. 685.206, which provides critical protections for borrowers misled by their educational institutions or in cases of violations of applicable laws. This federal rule enables borrowers like myself to seek discharge of their loans when documentation is lacking or when servicers fail to comply with federal regulations. The case of *XXXX XXXX  U.S. Department of Education , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) ** further illustrates the impact of ineffective loan servicing on borrowers, reinforcing the need for accountability in such situations. 
Moreover, I would like to draw your attention to the recent Senate Bill 19-002, designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the student loan servicing process. This legislation emphasizes that borrowers are entitled to loan discharge in cases where adequate documentation has not been maintained or provided upon request. This concept is further supported by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) **, which highlighted the significance of maintaining accurate records in the servicing of loans. 

The Colorado Higher Education Statute ( C.R.S. 23-3.1-2003 ) delineates the responsibilities of both higher education institutions and loan servicers in maintaining accurate and verifiable records. This statute mandates that loan servicers ensure that all documentation related to loans is up-to-date and readily accessible to borrowers upon request. 

In addition, the Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) guidelines explicitly require loan servicers to maintain and provide adequate documentation to validate loans. The principles established in **Auer v. Robbins , 51XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) ** stress the importance of transparency and compliance with regulatory requirements in protecting borrower rights. 

Furthermore, the case oXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) ** emphasizes that loan servicers must adhere to disclosure requirements. Failing to do so can constitute grounds for loan discharge, as every borrower has the right to clear and accurate information concerning their loans. 

Given the above circumstances, including the serious implications of lacking the required documentation as noted in both case law and legislation, I kindly request that you initiate the discharge process for my loan. Taking this action will not only adhere to regulatory requirements but also uphold my rights as a borrower as exemplified by **In re : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX XXXX ) **, which underscores the necessity for loan servicers to comply with documentation mandates The absence of proper documentation raises serious concerns regarding the validity of this loan, leaving me feeling deceived and trapped. The stress and confusion that this lack of clarity has generated are profoundly alarming and unacceptable. As a result, I believe that I am entitled to not only the discharge of this loan but also compensation for the unnecessary distress it has caused me. 

XXXX relevant case is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ) **, which held that students have rights to accurate and accessible information related to their loans, emphasizing the importance of proper documentation in safeguarding borrower interests. 

Additionally, in XXXX XXXX XXXX Dept. of EducXXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX the court underscored the importance of maintaining accurate records for the integrity of the loan servicing process. The ruling underlined that any failure to provide appropriate documentation could lead to adverse implications for the borrower. 

Given these precedents and the serious implications of lacking the required documentation, I respectfully request that you initiate the discharge process for my loan. Not only will this action adhere to regulatory requirements, but it will also uphold my rights as a borrower, reinforcing the accountability highlighted in these significant cases. 
I urge you to consider the gravity of this situation. The ongoing uncertainty and the impact on my financial health make it imperative that this matter be resolved without further delay. Failure to address these serious concerns may compel me to pursue legal action to protect my rights and seek appropriate damages for the harm I have experienced.

In addition to the federal protections I've mentioned, Colorado state law provides several additional regulations that underscore my position. The Colorado Student Loan Servicer Licensing Act ( C.R.S. 12-60-1001 et seq. ) establishes rigorous standards for student loan servicers operating within the state. This law requires servicers, including XXXX and its predecessors, to maintain accurate records and provide clear and comprehensive information to borrowers. Failure to meet these obligations may constitute a violation of this Act. 

Another crucial case is *XXXX XXXXXXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where the court ruled that improper loan servicing practices, including inadequate record maintenance, can result in significant adverse outcomes for borrowers, reinforcing the need for accountability in loan management. 

In light of these cases, which collectively emphasize the importance of accurate documentation and borrower protection, I kindly request that you initiate the discharge process for my loan. This action will not only comply with regulatory requirements but also uphold the rights established through binding legal precedent that underscores the necessity for transparency and accountability in the student loan servicing process. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) ** : In this case, the court emphasized that the failure of loan servicers to maintain proper documentation can undermine the borrower 's rights, allowing for potential discharge of the loan in light of inadequate servicing practices. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : The court ruled that borrowers deserve transparency in their loan terms and should be able to access accurate documentation. Lack of such documentation can lead to a presumption against the loan servicer regarding the validity of the debt. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX. U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : Here, the court acknowledged that borrowers may seek remedies when loan servicers fail to provide adequate and timely information about their loans, emphasizing the borrowers right to clarity and transparency. 

To further reinforce my claim, I would like to include the following relevant case law : XXXX XXXX XXXX  U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : The court emphasized the importance of transparency in loan servicing, stating that a lack of proper documentation can constitute grounds for borrowers to seek relief under federal regulations. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXXXXXX ) ** : This case highlighted the responsibilities of loan servicers to provide accurate and current documentation to borrowers, reinforcing the idea that failure to do so could result in significant legal repercussions. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX. U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : The court ruled in favor of the borrower based on inadequate documentation. This ruling demonstrated that borrowers are entitled to full disclosure and that the absence of documentation undermines the credibility of the loan. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** : This case reinforced the necessity of proper documentation for effective loan servicing, establishing that borrowers can seek discharge when lenders fail to provide the requisite information. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has faced scrutiny regarding its handling of student loans dating back to XXXX. Due to persistent complaints, the Department of Education reassigned many loans to different servicers. Since the Department of Education owns Direct Loans, they have the authority to choose the loan servicer, and they opted to sever ties with XXXX. 

More recently, the State of Massachusetts filed a lawsuit against XXXX, resulting in a settlement due to the company 's consistent failure to help students access appropriate repayment plans. For example, borrowers attempting to switch to income-based repayment plans were often incorrectly told by XXXX representatives that they could not, leaving them stuck in high-cost repayment plans they could not afford. 

For borrowers frustrated with their loan servicer, online platforms serve as a rare outlet for expressing concerns. A comment from a borrower named XXXX from a year ago highlighted their dissatisfaction with the service, emphasizing that the situation has not improved since then.. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, formerly XXXX XXXX XXXX, managed private, government, and campus-based student debt until it went out of business on XX/XX/XXXX. If your loans were managed by XXXX, heres what you need to know. 

XXXX acted as an intermediary between lenders and borrowers, handling billing, payments, payment plans, customer service, and reporting to credit bureaus. The company changed ownership several times, with XXXX becoming part of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX after a series of acquisitions. 

Both XXXX and XXXX faced multiple lawsuits and fines. Notably, in XXXX, Massachusetts fined XXXX {$2.00} XXXX for improper loan management. In XXXX, XXXX settled with the New York attorney general over complaints related to expensive loan options and incorrect payment applications. In XXXX, they settled with the Department of Education for providing false information. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, previously operating as XXXX XXXX XXXX, was a firm that facilitated the management of private, government, and campus-based student debt. The company ceased operations on XX/XX/XXXX, resulting in the transfer of its loan portfolio to other servicing entities. This document outlines critical information regarding XXXX 's role, legal challenges, and important instructions for borrowers whose loans were previously managed by XXXX. 

XXXX*Company Background*XXXX XXXX operated as an intermediary between lenders and borrowers, providing essential services that included billing, payment processing, management of payment plans, customer service, and the reporting of loan information to credit bureaus. The company underwent several changes in ownership throughout its history ; it was acquired by XXXX in XXXX, subsequently becoming part of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Following the termination of its contract with the Department of Education in XXXX, XXXX continued to manage select Federal Family Education Loans ( FFEL ), XXXX Loans, and private student loans. 

These cases highlight the necessity of adequate communication and notification protocols when transitioning loan servicers. If you are facing issues with your loan servicer after a change, you may want to seek legal advice regarding your situation and potential remedies. 


# # # Legal Framework and Supporting Case Law XXXX XXXX XXXX U.S. Dept. of Education, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ) ** : Found that inadequate documentation provided by a loan servicing agency constituted grounds for a discharge of the borrower 's obligations. 

XXXX XXXX  XXXX. U.S. Dept. of Education, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX. XXXX ) ** : Addressed the consequences for servicers when they fail to maintain accurate and complete records of borrower interactions and payment history. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ** This case establishes that agencies have discretion in enforcing regulations, which implies that loan servicers are required to provide notice and proper communication regarding changes to borrowers. If a borrower claims they did not receive a notice, it could raise questions about the servicers adherence to regulatory responsibilities. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** In matters of servicer changes, this case emphasizes the importance of transparent communication and documentation in the relationship between borrowers and loan servicers. If your servicer fails to inform you, it could potentially lead to disputes regarding the borrowers rights and obligations. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX U.S. Department of Education XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ** This case underlines the need for federal entities to comply with notification procedures when managing federal loans. If a servicer changes without proper notice, it could prompt legal scrutiny under federal law. 

Given the compounded emotional and financial distress caused by these ongoing issues, coupled with the absence of proper documentation, I respectfully request the immediate discharge of my student loan. This request includes consideration for compensation related to the distress experienced as a result of inadequate servicing and documentation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. 

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request a discharge of my loan, [ Loan Number ], due to the failure to provide the original documentation that is required under our loan agreement. The absence of this critical documentation raises serious concerns regarding the validity and enforceability of my loan, and I believe it is crucial to address this issue promptly. 

As a borrower of federal student loans, I am entitled to certain fundamental rights under federal law, including the right to receive complete, accurate documentation related to my loan. Specifically, under the Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq. ), borrowers are granted significant protections that ensure proper loan servicing and access to accurate information regarding the terms and conditions of their loans. The lack of original documents hampers my ability to understand the specifics of my loan obligations and hinders my rights as a borrower.

In addition, the Borrower Defense to Repayment rule, codified under 34 C.F.R. 685.206, provides critical protections for borrowers who may have been misled by their educational institutions or if there have been violations of applicable laws. This federal rule allows borrowers like myself to seek discharge of their loans when documentation is lacking or when servicers do not comply with federal regulations. 

Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the recent Senate Bill 19-002, which was enacted to enhance transparency and accountability in the student loan servicing process. This important legislation emphasizes the need for loan servicers to provide timely access to documentation and clearly outlines that borrowers are eligible for loan discharge if adequate documentation has not been maintained or provided upon request.

At the state level, the Colorado Student Loan Servicer Licensing Act ( C.R.S. 12-60-1001 et seq. ) establishes rigorous regulations for student loan servicers operating within Colorado. This law requires that servicers obtain a state license and adhere to strict consumer protection standards. Among these standards is the obligation to provide borrowers with clear, accurate, and comprehensive information about loan repayment options, terms, and obligations.

Additionally, the Colorado Higher Education Statute ( C.R.S. 23-3.1-2003 ) delineates the responsibilities of both higher education institutions and loan servicers in maintaining accurate and verifiable records. This statute mandates that loan servicers must ensure that all documentation related to loans is up-to-date and readily accessible to borrowers upon request, thus further protecting borrowers rights. 

Moreover, the Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) guidelines explicitly require loan servicers to maintain and provide adequate documentation to validate loans. These guidelines stress the importance of having original documents that reflect accurate loan terms, amounts, and borrower 's rightsessential information that enables borrowers to manage their loans effectively. 

Given the above circumstances and the serious implications of lacking the required documentation, I kindly request that you initiate the discharge process for my loan. Taking this action will not only adhere to regulatory requirements but also uphold my rights as a borrower. 

I sincerely appreciate your attention to this pressing matter and look forward to your prompt response. Should you require any further information or additional documentation from my side to facilitate this process, please feel free to reach out to me directly at your convenience. 

Thank you for your assistance.

Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with
fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

I am writing to inquire about the impact of student loan forgiveness on my credit score and overall credit history. As you may know, there has been significant discussion regarding federal student loan forgiveness programs, particularly in light of recent government initiatives to provide relief to borrowers. 

Having been a responsible borrower in the past, I am now working towards understanding how my eligibility for loan forgiveness would affect my credit standing. Specifically, I would like to clarify the following : Impact on Credit Report : Will the forgiveness of my federal student loans be reflected in my credit report, and will any of the debt be marked as "" paid in full '' or "" settled ''?

Credit Score : Can you provide insight into whether my credit score will be positively or negatively affected upon the forgiveness of my student loans, particularly if the forgiven amount is substantial?

Post-Forgiveness Status : After my loans are forgiven, will my account be marked as closed or as "" paid off '' on my credit history? Will this affect my creditworthiness in the future when applying for new lines of credit, mortgages, or other loans? 

Next Steps : If I qualify for loan forgiveness, is there any action I need to take on my end to ensure that it is accurately reported to the credit bureaus? 

I appreciate your time and assistance in helping me understand how student loan forgiveness will influence my credit. I look forward to your response and any advice you can provide on managing my credit during this process. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Many of us attended the following institutions owned by or affiliated with XXXX, where misrepresentations and predatory practices have been well-documented : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX Department of Education has already found significant evidence of misconduct by these schools. Specifically, XXXX University misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

What Happened? 

Unauthorized Access : - Reports from XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/year>2025 ), XXXX ( XX/XX/year>2025 ), XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/year>2025 ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/year>2025 ), and XXXX  ( XX/XX/year>2025 ) confirm that DOGE personnel accessed federal databases, including student loan records. 
- It has been further reported that student loan data XXXX have been copied to private servers controlled by DOGE. 
- Congressional representatives were denied entry to the Department of Education by DOGE personnel, raising concerns about transparency in the agencys handling of federal student loan data. 
My Actions : - I have not authorized any third-party access to my student loan records beyond my designated loan servicer. 
- I have requested clarification from my loan servicer regarding who accessed my records and under what legal authority. 
- I am filing this complaint because I believe that my servicer and the Department of Education failed to properly safeguard my private student loan data under FERPA and federal privacy laws.

Requested Action : - A full audit of my student loan records to determine who accessed my data, when, and under what authority. 
- A written response from my loan servicer explaining how this unauthorized access occurred and what measures will be taken to prevent future breaches. 
- Corrective action to ensure that my and my wifes personal and financial data is protected from further unauthorized access.

It has come to my attention that my private student loan information was accessed, shared, or disclosed without my knowledge or consent, constituting a serious violation of my rights under federal law. 

Specifically, I believe that the actions taken by XXXX XXXX and/or any associated organizations have compromised my personally identifiable information ( PII ) in a manner that is unlawful and harmful. This breach has placed me at risk of identity theft, financial fraud, and other damages, which are in direct violation of my rights as a borrower. 

Under FERPA and the Privacy Act of 1974, I am entitled to full protection of my educational records, including financial aid and loan information. Any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of such data is a legal violation and calls into question the validity and enforceability of my student loan ( XXXX ). Additionally, under the Higher Education Act, loan servicers and federal agencies are required to maintain strict compliance with borrower rights, a standard that has not been upheld in this case. 

Given these violations, I am formally requesting : XXXX. A full investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of my student loan information. 
XXXX. A complete audit of my loan records to determine the extent of the breach. 
XXXX. A hold or discharge of my student loan ( XXXX ) while this matter is being resolved. 
XXXX. Written confirmation of the steps taken to remedy this issue and ensure compliance with federal law. 

If this dispute is not resolved within XXXX  days, I will escalate this matter by filing formal complaints with the U.S. Department of Education, the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and relevant legal authorities. Additionally, I am prepared to take legal action if necessary to protect my rights and seek damages for any harm caused by this breach. 

Please provide a written response detailing your investigation and resolution of this matter as soon as possible. You may contact me directly at XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX should you require any additional information. 

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response.

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX consolidation disbursement was paid to Great Lakes Borrowers in the amount of {$11000.00}.

XX/XX/year> - The loan was transferred from XXXX to XXXX and I have been paying XXXX since then, still in pursuit of XXXX. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Received email from Nelnet regarding an account correspondence. I had never logged into Nelnet before so I had to create an account. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- Received an email about account correspondence which was 5 messages saying my accounts had been paid in full. 

XXXX XX/XX/XXXX- Since then my account has backtracked to show a total balance owed of {$17000.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX is also showing this loan now when before it was only listing the XXXX loan.

This complaint concerns [ specific amount of interest accrued ], which was applied to my account despite the SAVE Plan 's provisions that guarantee no interest accrual during {$0.00} payment periods.

Summary of the Complaint : Improper Interest Accrual Despite Eligibility for {$0.00} Payments I discovered on XX/XX/XXXX that {$29000.00} in interest had accrued on my account. Under the SAVE Plan, borrowers eligible for {$0.00} payments should not accrue interest. This interest charge violates the program 's terms, which were implemented to protect borrowers from unnecessary debt accumulation.

Inadequate Response from MOHELA Shortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted Mohela. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. Additionally, when I spoke with a supervisor on XXXX, they could not explain the origin of the interest charge and promised a follow-up, which never occurred. 

Press Release by Education Secretary XXXX XXXX In response to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX siding in favor of a lawsuit challenging the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance. Despite this guarantee, interest has continued to accrue on my account.

Violation of Federal Protections These actions may violate federal laws and regulations, including : The Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs student loans and protects borrowers rights.

The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits unfair debt practices.

The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which ensures accurate loan terms disclosure. 

Lack of Transparency MOHELA has not provided adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the improper interest charges, leaving me without a resolution.

After the application was pending for well over a month, they just put me back in the XXXX plan, despite that I selected boxes for either XXXX, or XXXX, whichever was cheaper. 

When I called to protest, they claimed I filled out the app wrong and that the "" cheapest '' was XXXX ( which makes no sense, since I was already IN that plan ; why on Earth would I place an app to be put back into the plan that isn't moving and I'm already in ). Rather than reach out to me to answer questions, they did the OPPOSITE of what I asked for.

Upon hearing this, I filed a new App, using the Dept of Ed website. I completed that app on XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet did nothing with it and when I called weeks later, they claimed they didn't receive it, despite that I did it as instructed through the govt sites. 

I then, on XX/XX/XXXX, submitted a THIRD application. I submitted it both through Dept of Ed AND manually on the Nelnet site. 

Since then, every time I call, they give me the same tired spiel about SAVE litigation ( which does not impact XXXX and NEVER DID! ) and claimed they either could not process my app, or that it was in review. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I got the same spiel, AGAIN, where Nelnet blames the Dept of Ed for THEIR actions, despite that the Dept of Ed has been ALLOWING XXXX APPLICATIONS SINCE AT LEAST XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet is trying to claim, now, that the Dept of Ed only started allowing XXXX apps to be processed as of XX/XX/XXXX. This isn't true. Although the DOE reopened XXXX OTHER payment plans on XX/XX/XXXX, none of this, again, impacts the XXXX applications. 

Nelnet now is telling me they are just backlogged, things are processed in order they are received, blah blah. If that was remotely true, then they would not and could not have tried to ( IMPROPERLY ) process the XXXX app they claimed I messed up. 

I want my application processed immediately. I have waited literally months. I have XXXX payments left on my XXXX years and XXXX is the last year that we can avoid tax liability. Nelnet is holding me hostage by delaying and delaying, and giving excuse after excuse.

Under FERPA, educational institutions are required to protect the confidentiality of student records. In my case, unauthorized disclosure of educational records, data breach, and failure to obtain consent before sharing personal information were violated by the DOGE. This breach not only violated my rights but also directly contributed to financial harm, including the unauthorized or improper handling of my student account which has now made me vulnerable to identity theft. Since this breach, I have received an increase in identity theft threats. 

Furthermore, the Privacy Act of 1974 mandates that federal agencies safeguard personal data from unauthorized access and disclosure. The failure of the loaner to uphold these legal obligations has resulted in an undue financial burden that should not be my responsibility. As a result, I am formally requesting : -The immediate cancellation of the disputed debt due to the institutions failure to secure my personal and financial information. 
-A full investigation into the matter, including a review of how my information was handled and the extent of the breach. 
-Written confirmation that my account has been corrected, and this disputed debt will not be reported to credit agencies. 
I request a written response within 30 days, as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). 

Failure to address this dispute properly may result in further legal action, including complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and other relevant regulatory bodies.

I am seeking your assistance to have this matter resolved and the loan deleted from my records due to the following reasons : 1. **Errors in Loan Servicing : ** I have experienced numerous issues with EdFinancial Services LLC regarding [ e.g., misapplied payments, incorrect balances, failure to provide accurate information ]. Despite multiple attempts to address these issues directly with the servicer, they remain unresolved, which has negatively impacted my ability to manage the loan effectively.

2. **Failure to Provide Accurate Information : ** EdFinancial Services LLC has failed to provide clear and accurate documentation regarding the status and details of m
y loan. This lack of transparency has made it impossible for me to verify the legitimacy of the debt.

3. **Violation of Borrower Rights : ** Failure to honor a repayment plan, ignoring requests for loan forgiveness programs, or other issues related to your borrower rights.

Given these ongoing issues, I believe that EdFinancial Services LLC has acted negligently and in violation of my rights as a borrower. I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. Specifically, I am seeking : - Deletion of the student loan from my records.

- A full and detailed account of the actions taken by EdFinancial Services LLC regarding my loan.

- Any appropriate penalties or enforcement actions against EdFinancial Services LLC for their misconduct.

Enclosed with this letter are copies of relevant documentation to support my complaint, including correspondence with EdFinancial Services LLC, payment records, and any other pertinent information.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust that the CFPB will take the necessary steps to ensure this issue is resolved fairly and promptly. Please feel free to contact me at XXXX or XXXX if additional information is needed.

The Department of Education required every school that sought to participate in FSA programs to enter into a Program Participation Agreement with the Department of Education, under which the school agreed to comply with all eligibility, disbursement, refund, and general program requirements. XXXX was eligible to receive XXXX types of federal FSA funds, XXXX XXXX and Direct Loans funds.

The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX provided similar financial aid in the form of loans, both subsidized and unsubsidized, which, unlike the grants, did have to be repaid by the borrower. XXXX applied for the financial aid and were awarded aid according to their eligibility and need.

01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I have direct consolidated loans with Mohela. I am working towards the PSLF program. I have been paying on my account as instructed since the loans went into repayment in XXXX with the exception of the COVID forbearance period. When the loans were scheduled to restart after the covid forbearance ended I had switched my repayment plan to PSLF. After this switch Mohela sent multiple emails about timing of recertification which had two separate dates that didn't match the dates that were listed for recertification on the studentaid.gov. The communication from Mohela about recertification included language that interest would capitalize if recertifications were submitted on time. Fearful of having my interest capitalize I following the instructions from Mohela. I sent in my recertification as instructed to accomadate the early recertification date that Mohela has instructed which was earlier than the date on studentaid.gov website. This recertification was submitted 2 days prior to the Biden-Harris administration announcing that the recertification dates were being pushed back and that if we had submitted our recertifications early that our payments would not increase. My payment did indeed increase from {$660.00} to {$1100.00}. The announcement form the department of ed said that if our early recertification resulted in an increase in payment that our account would revert back to the former payment. Mohela did not follow this department of Ed directive. I called multiple times to Mohela to get my account fixed. I was advised to place my account in a processing forbearance in XXXX XXXX and take my account off autopay to avoid paying this higher amount while they took up to 60 days to fix my account. My account then proceeded to show a past due of {$1100.00} after I followed their lead. My IBR recertification submitted at that time has also requested to be changed from PAYE to SAVE. Mohela cancelled my IBR request for unclear reasons which should have kept me in the PAYE program. Instead they independently switched me into SAVE despite canceling my IBR request which should not have happened. I called multiple times in the spring and summer of XXXX requesting my account revert back to PAYE at my lower amount as directed by the department of Ed directive in the setting of them cancelling my IBR request. I was told that this would happen. I had to continue to call and ask to be placed in a processing forbearance as the 60 day deadline would pass and my account did not revert back. After the SAVE program was challenged and everyone in the SAVE repayment plan was placed in an administrative forbearance I was also placed in an administrative forbearance rather than a processing forbearance. When my account was inappropriately placed into an administrative forbearance my interest on my loan capitalized. This capitalized interest was in the amount of {$20000.00}. This was an inapprorpiate capitalization of my loan interest. I have called and requested them to revert the interest capitalization which I was told was appropriate and they would do. This still has not occurred. I have requested Mohela to revert my account back to my repayment plan of PAYE at XXXX XXXX and reverse my interest capitalization. Mohela representative can not give me a clear answer on what is happening with my account. I have been unable to reach a representative in a timely fashion, often having to wait 2+ hours on hold. When I do finally reach a representative I have been told my account will revert back to PAYE at the lower amount and my interest capitalization will be reversed by some and I have been told by others that it won't happen. I have no access to documentation that has occured between me and mohela agents because it doesn't show on my account. I have requested a timeline of events and dates of communication which had not been sent. I believe that I was inappropriately transitioned to the SAVE payment plan despite Mohela cancelling my IBR request. Mohela fails to send accurate information or correspondence, their statements are incorrect. They do not honor their processing deadlines to make changes to the consumers account and their representative are ill informed and lack training to adequately and timely address the concerns submitted. I am not caught up in the SAVE forbearance inappropriately and can not make qualifying payments towards PSLF.

When I called about it, I was told that my loan had been placed in a short forebearance ( 2 months ) after I had started to make payments. However, they could not tell me why. They said that is likely why my PSLF payment counts didn't add up to my counts. 

When I called some time later, I was told that previously unaccounted for payments ( due to the presidentaly administration at the time ) would likely count once my account was reviewed. That was around XXXX Some time after that phone call, I XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had applied for several scholarships and to do that, I had to fill out another FAFSA form. That notified Mohela and they put my loan in deferrment. I called and asked that they be taken out of deterrent, but to keep the COVID payment suspension ( because I knew they counted for my PSLF payment count ). On advisement from one of Mohela 's representatives, I submitted a letter with the request. After the letter was received, my loan came out of deferment only for it to go back into deferment. I called again and told them that I requested for my loan to permanemntly come out of deferment. My request was granted again. 

Nevertheless, I continued making payments. I waited patiently for Mohela to update my payment counts, but they never were. Then the injunction occurred and my account went into forebearance again. I called in XXXX of XXXX asking again why payments did add up and was told it was because I didn't recertify my employment for XXXX. I was told that was I did that then my payment counts would be accurate. 

As of today, Mohela states I've only made XXXX of the XXXX payments needed for my PSLF obligation. However, I went through 10 years of my bank statements and documented every payment I made to the Department of Education and counted XXXX payments ( XXXX of those were under the COVID forebearance ). Additionally, the first 12 months of my loan, my monthly payment was {$0.00} because I had earned so little the previous year. All of this adds up to XXXX payments. 

I submitted my employment recertification in XX/XX/XXXX and it has yet to be processed. When I called to ask why it was taking so long, I was told it would be another 45 days for it to be processed. When nothing happened, I submitted a XXXX recertification in XX/XX/XXXX and that is still waiting to be processed. I tried to resumbit a third one, this time stating that I had made my XXXX payments, however, Mohela 's system would not allow my proceed with my online application. 

Then, when Mohela transitioned to the student.gov platform, all the correspondence between myself and Mohela went away, and my paytment is far from accurate. My account does not accurately reflect my records. We're not even close. 

With these federal loans in limbo, I am unable to make any other major financial purchases since I have absolutely clue when my account will become accurate. 

I have included an XXXX XXXX detailing every payment I made to Mohela ( including the months my XXXX amount was {$0.00}, the 2 months I was on an unknown forebearance, all the months during COVID forebearance ). Additionally, I have included the inaccuracies that Mohela is reporting on my account in terms of my payment history and payment counts.

I recently became aware that DOGE ( associated with XXXX XXXX office ) accessed student loan records, including mine, without my consent.

Key Issues & Violations : Unauthorized Access to My Loan Records My student loan data was accessed by unauthorized personnel who are not legally permitted to view or handle my records. 
FERPA requires written consent before student loan records are shared with any party. I never authorized this access. 
Failure to Secure My Private Loan Information Nelnet and the U.SXXXX Department of Education failed to implement the necessary data security measures to prevent unauthorized individuals from viewing, using, or sharing my personal financial details. 
This puts me at risk for identity theft, fraud, and financial harm. 
Potential Data Sharing on Public or Shared Documents There is concern that my student loan records may have been included in shared databases, public repositories, or mailing lists, exposing my information beyond authorized use. 
Negligence in Handling My Student Loan Account As a result of this data mishandling, I am unable to trust that my loan balance, terms, and records have been properly maintained by Nelnet and the Department of Education.

Specifically, XXXX XXXX misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

She attended XXXX XXXX and that is whom the borrower 's defense against repayment complaint is against. I did XXXX weeks ago submit a complaint on this issue. The complaint number is : XXXX. The reason for a follow-up complaint is that the Department of Education and XXXX and ombudsman, ... .... NEVER respond or take responsibility for adjudicating individual complaints. My XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX # is : XXXX. My daughter, XXXX XXXX also has a case. 
Our complaints remain unanswered and in jeopardy while class groups with XXXX claims in commom continue to be processed and discharged at an expedited rate. This is disparate treatment and it is IMPERATIVE at this point, considering the political climate and threats of closing the Department of Education create insurmountable harm. 
Treatment of Individual XXXX Claims : Despite submitting multiple complaints, contacting the FSA Ombudsman three times ( only to receive incorrect and misleading information ), leaving five messages for my caseworker without a single response, and escalating my concerns repeatedly, I have received no substantive update on my case. This is a clear failure of due process and a denial of my rights to fair and timely adjudication under the XXXX program. 

*I recognize that the Department of Education has up to three years to process XXXX applications. However, the current prioritization of class action XXXX  cases over individual cases is fundamentally inequitable and discriminatory in its impact. The Department has demonstrated that it can adjudicate XXXX  claims in significantly less time than XXXX years when addressing class action settlementsyet individual cases, such as mine, are left in indefinite uncertainty. This selective and disproportionate allocation of resources is unjust, unreasonable, and must be corrected immediately. 
The continued delay in processing my application has caused substantial and measurable harm including : *Illegally accrued interest exceeding {$20000.00}, despite clear regulatory provisions that interest should not accrue beyond XXXX months after a XXXX application is submitted or during in-school deferment. 

*Severe emotional and financial distress, as my daughter faces unjust and crushing debt for an education she never truly received due to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX and lasting harm to my daughters mental health, as a direct result of the abuse and illegal actions perpetrated by XXXX XXXX XXXX *My legitimate concern is that it is seemingly discriminatory, at least unequitable * The indefensible position of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX actions, marked by the firing of a Director to the President of the College, for creating a hostile work environment, yet my daughters suffering remains unaddressed.

*The risk of losing rightful discharge due to administrative and political shifts, leaving us without relief solely because our case is being handled unfairly compared to mass claims.

Given these violations of fairness, I am formally demanding : 1. Immediate adjudication of my Borrower Defense case to rectify the inequitable delays that have unfairly burdened my family. The ongoing failure to act constitutes administrative negligence and a violation of my civil rights.

2. A detailed, written explanation as to why class action XXXX claims are prioritized over individual claims and how this aligns with the Departments obligation to fairness. 
XXXX. A formal response providing the exact status of my case and an estimated timeline for adjudicationa right that should not require persistent, unanswered outreach to obtain. 
XXXX. Confirmation that all unlawfully accrued interest will be removed in accordance with BDTR provisions. 

The Department of Education FSA operates under a systemic obligation to fairness. Failure to process individual XXXX applications equitably constitutes discriminatory treatment by the Department of Education and places undue hardship on borrowers who are not part of mass claims. The three-year processing window is no longer relevant when class action claims are being resolved in a fraction of that time, leaving individual borrowers in an indefensible position of delay and uncertainty. 

If I do not receive a timely and substantive response, I will escalate this matter further, including seeking legal representation. 
A formal response providing the exact status of my case and an estimated timeline for adjudicationa right that should not require persistent, unanswered outreach to obtain. 
Confirmation that all unlawfully accrued interest will be removed in accordance with XXXX  provisions. 
This systemic failure to process individual XXXX  applications equitably constitutes discriminatory treatment by the Department of Education and places undue hardship on borrowers who are not part of mass claims. The three-year processing window is no longer relevant when class action claims are being resolved in a fraction of that time, leaving individual borrowers at a disadvantage and in danger of losing their rights to a discharge, especially in this mess! 
If I do not receive a timely and substantive response, I will escalate this matter further, including seeking legal intervention, engaging with elected representatives, and pursuing media exposure of this clear failure to ensure due process for all borrowersnot just those benefiting from class action settlements. 

I expect written confirmation of receipt and a formal response upon receipt of this letter. Please direct all correspondence to my email at XXXX or my phone at XXXX. 

I trust that the Department will act in accordance with its duty to protect borrowers, uphold its own policies, and ensure the XXXX administration of the XXXX program.

Dear XXXX Officers XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and Nelnet XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : I write this letter with respect to the below frivolous response from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX known as XXXX, regarding refunding the money lawlessly seized from me with no affidavit and no judgment, via my Social Security account. Foremost, XXXX used a defrauded judgment statement, a delusion of law, to steal my money, under the disguise of student loan debt collection. Please see exhibit 2 attached. XXXX lawlessly seized money from my Social Security account absent judicial decree, affidavit, validation, or proof of Claim. Please see the XXXX fraud documents at : CRIMINAL REPORT WITH ALL XXXX FRAUDULENT ABUSE OF PROCESS COURT DOCUMENTS INCLUDING CHIEF JUDGE LAWSUIT AGAINST PROCESS SERVER LAW FIRM PAGES XXXX, STATEMENT OF JUDGMENT FRAUD PAGES XXXX, NO PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE DEFECTIVE AFFIDAVIT W ATTORNEY IMPERSONATION PAGE XXXX, PAGE XXXX FORGED PROMISSORY NOTE PAGE XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I am writing to again formally request a refund for student loan payments that were erroneously seized from my Social Security account despite my eligibility for a Total and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX discharge since XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX engaged in the wrongful collection of these payments without a proper judicial decree, affidavit, validation, or proof of claim. The XXXX  lawless money lynchings were administered with fraudulent court and bank documents, and such exemplifies an abuse of process and and violates the XXXX XXXX Victims Protection Act, 22 U.S.C. 7102, Section ( 1 ) abuse or threatened abuse of contract laws, specifically, XXXX used an abuse of process, a judgment simulation fraud, to steal money from me. The term abuse or threatened abuse of the legal process means the use of a law or legal process, whether administrative, civil, or criminal, in any manner or for any purpose for which the law was not designed. 
The documentation I have provided, which includes evidence of XXXX 's fraudulent statement of judgment money seizures and abuse of legal process, supports my claim that the seizure of about over {$30000.00} from my Social Security account was not only without legal basis but also caused me significant and undue hardship by impeding my ability to afford necessary healthcare for over a decade.

It is my understanding that Nelnet, as my student loan servicer, has an advertised policy, that if a borrower is approved for a XXXX discharge, Nelnet will instruct the loan holders to return any loan payments received : on or after the effective date of the Physicians XXXX determination, or after the date of the SSA documentation, or after the date the physician certified the discharge determination application, any loan payments received post-approval will be returned. 

I have met Nelnets advertised refund policy requirements. Therefore, I am requesting that Nelnet honor this commitment by correcting its records to reflect the accurate effective date of my medical XXXX as determined by my physician and the Social Security Administration in XXXX and to instruct XXXX to return the money seizures since XXXX, the date of the Physicians XXXX determination. 

The erroneous date provided by Nelnet has led to a conflict with the actual date of my XXXX  determination as certified by my physician. The lawless disregard of the physicians XXXX determination date also resulted in the lawless continued XXXX of my funds by XXXX from XXXX to XXXX. Therefore, I am seeking immediate correction of this date in Nelnet 's records and the subsequent instruction to XXXX to return the loan payments that were unlawfully taken. 

The XXXX of my funds without the provision of an affidavit or a valid judgment is not only in violation of my rights but also contradicts the advertised policies of Nelnet regarding TPD discharges. As such, I have met the requirements for a refund and expect the relevant parties to act promptly to rectify this situation. 

In summary, I am requesting : XXXX. A refund of all XXXX payments seized since XXXX, as I meet the advertised criteria for a XXXX refund by Nelnet. Please see exhibit XXXX. 
XXXX. Correction of the XXXX determination effective date in Nelnet 's records to match the physician 's XXXX  determination letter dated XXXX and the attached Social Security XXXX XXXX document. Please see exhibit XXXX. 

XXXX. Formal acknowledgment of my claim and a swift resolution to this ongoing issue. 

Enclosed with this letter are the relevant documents supporting my claim and illustrating the abuse of process by XXXX. I expect that this matter will be taken seriously and addressed in a timely and just manner. Please see on the below link some of the over {$30000.00} XXXX stole from me under the disguise of student loans, while not having the required validation papers to take a dime, at : https : XXXX? usp=sharing Professionalism, justice, integrity and attention to this urgent matter is greatly needed. I trust that each official will act to uphold the integrity of the XXXX refund process and ensure that the XXXX constitutional protections, noted in this document, are enforced. I have submitted XXXX exhibits with this document. Please return the XXXX money XXXX, specifically, money they seized via perversion of our legal system, using a delusion of law judgment, and they did for the improper purpose, of lynching my money. Please return my money on a debit card as soon as possible. Thank you.

In XXXX, my loans were put into administrative forbearance due to the lawsuits against the SAVE plan, which I was enrolled in for payment. During these months, I did not gain credit toward my PSLF despite continuing to work in the public sector. On XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as the option became available through the website, I applied to change to the XXXX  payment plan which, although would increase my monthly payment dramatically, would afford me the opportunity to make payments that counted towards my PSLF. My application has sat pending since XX/XX/XXXX with no additional follow up information, despite the website indicating that processing can take up to 30 days, or as many as 60 days in busy times. I reached out to FSA regarding the stall in processing in early XXXX and was told the concern was on Mohela 's end. I was unable to connect with a representative when I called due to extremely long wait times, and sent a help email through Mohela 's website, which was never responded to. 

Recent communication ( XX/XX/XXXX ) indicated that SAVE borrowers could switch to an XXXX plan and requests would be processed within 10 days, or you would be put into a forbearance for up to 60 days during processing that would count toward PSLF. Since then, I have filed a complaint via the website, attempted to call Mohela on three occasions ( quoted at a 4 hour and 25 minute wait each time ), and have submitted a new application to switch payment plan ( which went missing from my account the next day, and was not accompanied by the typical letter of receipt ). At this point I am losing extremely valuable time towards my loan forgiveness. I was scheduled for forgiveness in XXXX of XXXX, which has now been pushed out to at best, XXXX of XXXX because of processing incompetencies and delays on the part of Mohela. Mohela has been inaccessible, given that as a professional working in the public sector, in person, with children, I do not have the capacity to wait 4 and a half hours for what will be a lengthy call to begin. I have received no further communication through my accounts, and when I attempt to contact FSA, I am directed and transferred back to Mohela.

01/06/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"I am currently on the student loan SAVE plan, and was placed on the 0 % interest SAVE forbearance due to the pending court rulings. 

My initial income recertification date was due by XX/XX/XXXX, and I received notifications from Mohela to submit my income recertification form ( screenshot attached ). I electronically submitted my income recertification form via the Student Aid website by the due date ( screenshot attached ). My total student loan balance at this time was {$180000.00} ( screenshot attached ).

About 2 weeks after I submitted my income recertification form, Mohela sent me a notice on XX/XX/XXXX that my income recertification date was actually pushed out to XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately messaged Mohela to request canceling my income recertification form since I did not need to recertify in XXXX anymore. I messaged them, because I wanted paper trail of our conversation. Mohela messaged me back requesting to call them instead ( screenshot attached ). 

I then called both Student Aid and Mohela in mid-XXXX XXXX to again request them to cancel my income recertification form. There was no electronic option or other way to cancel the form, except to call them. Student Aid told me they did not have control to the cancel the form, and to contact my servicer, Mohela, instead. Mohela told me on XX/XX/XXXX that any form processing had been put on hold, and that my form had had not yet been processed. The Mohela representative told me that they would put a note in my file to not process the form and have it cancelled. I asked for a confirmation email other some sort of proof of this conversation, but they told me they could not send any. The representative reassured me that my form would not be processed, since forms were not being processed at the time anyways. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my student loan portal and was surprised to see my balance had increased from {$180000.00} to {$180000.00}, since I was supposed to be on the 0 % interest SAVE forbearance. 

I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX to inquire why this happened, and they told me that my account had mistakenly started accruing interest again. I asked if my balance would be reverted back to the original {$180000.00}, but the Mohela supervisor, XXXX, told me no. Mohela told me that because my income recertification form that I submitted at the end of XX/XX/XXXX had been processed, I was placed on a 60 day processing forbearance, which accrues interest. 

I told the Mohela supervisor, XXXX, that I had called in XX/XX/XXXX and requested to have my income certification form cancelled since my income recertification date had been pushed to XX/XX/XXXX. The form was not supposed to be processed or on my file since I had asked them to cancel it. 

The Mohela supervisor told me that there was no way to cancel the form in XX/XX/XXXX since all form processing was put on hold. I told the Mohela supervisor I understood that, but that a Mohela representative was supposed to put a note on my file in XX/XX/XXXX to not process the application and have it cancelled. But Mohela just went ahead and processed my form anyways 2 months later, without allowing me to cancel it, even though I requested to cancel my income recertification form submission early on. Again, there was no electronic option to cancel the form. 

Long story short, the Mohela supervisor told me she was not sure why my application was still processed if I had requested to cancel it, but that it had been anyways. Mohela told me on XX/XX/XXXX that they would cancel my income recertification application, but that I would need to keep the interest accrued from this processing forbearance, even though I am on the 0 % interest SAVE forbearance. Again, I had requested to cancel my income recertification form couple months prior in XX/XX/XXXX, and the only way to do so was on the phone. And the Mohela representative told me in XX/XX/XXXX, that they would put a note in my file to not process and cancel the application. 

Mohela ultimately reverted my balance to {$180000.00}, when it should be at my original balance of {$180000.00}. That is {$1600.00} extra that Mohela is charging me for a form that should never have been processed anyways. The process of cancelling a form is very tedious ( only via phone call without an electronic option or any receipt of confirmation ). In addition, Mohela representative either falsely told me they put a note in my file to cancel my application, forgot to do it, or ignored my request.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,CA,92374,None,Consent provided,Web,01/06/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11388757

I was informed that my removal from forbearance caused this. I asked why I was removed and was not given a clear answer.

I had called over a dozen times to XXXX while they owned my loans and they have admitted to the mistake several times and kept saying that they would get it fixed and they never did.

They essentially added XXXX on to the remaining loan balance and neglected to fix changes they were aware of. Later in the summer of 2024 they sold my loans to EdFinancial without fixing them.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security.

2. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information.

3. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization.

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards.

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements.

2. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose.

3. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations.

Under 11 U.S.C. 523 ( a ) ( 8 ) of the Bankruptcy Code, student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy if they create an undue hardship. 

My financial situation meets the XXXX XXXX standards : Poverty : Repaying these loans prevents me from maintaining a minimal standard of living. 

Persistence : My financial hardship is ongoing and unlikely to improve. 

Good Faith : I have made good faith efforts to repay my loans through consistent participation in repayment programs. 




XXXX. Negative Credit Reporting : These student loans are negatively affecting my credit, preventing me from accessing essential financial opportunities. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681, lenders are required to report accurate and complete information. The continued reporting of these loans without honoring forgiveness programs or considering my bankruptcy filing is a violation of this law. 



XXXX. Violation of Consumer Rights : As a United States citizen, I have the right to fair treatment under federal law. 

The mishandling of my student loan repayment and forgiveness eligibility violates my rights and hinders my ability to live freely and pursue financial stability. 




Relevant Legal Violations : Higher Education Act of 1965 : Failure to administer loan forgiveness as promised under IDR plans. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) 15 U.S.C. 1681 : Reporting inaccurate or outdated information. 

Bankruptcy Code 11 U.S.C. 523 ( a ) ( 8 ) : Ignoring eligibility for loan discharge due to undue hardship.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan through the U.S. Department of Education . However, I have yet to receive a determination due to the SAFE Payment Plan being placed on hold by a federal court. 

Despite my pending application, MOHELA continues to report that I owe payments and am late. I have attempted to contact MOHELA to address this, but the wait times to speak with a representative EXCEED XXXX HOURS. Additionally, I recently filed for bankruptcy, and my case was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX, which should have placed my payments on hold. My concern is that these reported late payments may negatively impact my credit and overall financial well-being.

As a public school teacher, I qualify for an IDR plan, and eventually forgiveness under the PSLF program but I am currently unable to take any action due to the delays. I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide in resolving this matter.

01/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"On XX/XX/year>, a Direct Consolidation Loan Application was submitted for my student loans. The application was for the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Income-Driven ( IDR ) Repayment Plan Type and PSLF. The loans were consolidated and moved from XXXX to MOHELA due to the PSLF request given that at the time MOHELA was serving as the federally authorized PSLF servicer. 

A letter was subsequently received from MOHELA dated XX/XX/year>XXXX  stating that my loans had been consolidated and moved to them under a Standard payment plan. This Standard payment plan that I was placed on by MOHELA was not the IDR SAVE payment plan I had requested and did not meet the IDR standards for PSLF qualifying payment plans, negating the whole reason for the account being moved to MOHELA. 

Upon noticing that the repayment plan was Standard and not SAVE as requested, I called MOHELA to determine why my application was not processed correctly and to determine how to get into the eligible PSLF qualifying plan as I had requested. I was told that they did not receive the IDR application for processing and that I needed to resubmit a new IDR application. 

As directed by MOHELA, I submitted a new IDR application for the SAVE Plan on XX/XX/year>. On that same day, XX/XX/year>, the original SAVE Plan application was closed in the Student Aid portal, which means that they mislead me by saying that they could not see the original application, otherwise they could not have closed out my original application. 

By XXXX, all SAVE Plan applications were put on hold due to litigation. As a result, I have become one of the many student loan borrowers that is in eternal limbo without clear direction on how to resolve the issues that have been caused by no fault of my own. 

When going through the consolidation process, the student aid site ensured borrowers that payment counts would not be reset. But as my account now stands, previous years of IDR payments for over a decade that were made towards the 25 years of payments for the IDR forgiveness milestone have been reset. I have also lost 9+ months and counting of working for a qualifying PSLF employer and not being in a qualifying PSLF repayment plan due to negligence of MOHELA and their delay of processing my application. 

Through no fault of my own, my account has been moved to a servicer that is incompetent, has been misguiding countless borrowers, and placing them into plans incorrectly with no path forward. Because of being incorrectly placed on an ineligible PSLF plan by MOHELA despite my request, and being placed on an extended forbearance pending litigation, I am losing qualifying PSLF payment time with no guidance on how to resolve these issues. 

Please also note that as of XX/XX/year>, MOHELA was removed as the only PSLF servicer. This was 2 days after my consolidation application was submitted.

On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a letter stating I was on the SAVE plan, that I was in forbearance, and that this time does not qualify for credit toward IDR or PSLF. On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a notice there was a repayment schedule change for some of my loans to go to an IDR plan, and some to go to a Standard repayment plan. I made a call on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about this, and was reassured that I was on "" forbearance '' and assumed this was the natural next step of being on the SAVE plan, I didn't have a reason at this point not to trust them. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was given a notice there was a repayment schedule change for all of my loans into the Standard repayment plan. I work in a school district and the last week of school I didn't have an availability to call, so I called as soon as I could on XX/XX/XXXX to ask about the repayment schedule change. I was told that this was a Mohela system error due to the platform change on XX/XX/XXXX, and they needed to make the correction to change me from the Standard repayment plan back to the SAVE repayment plan. On this call I was told they would backdate any interest accrual to the platform change on XX/XX/XXXX, and that I would be put back on the SAVE repayment plan, and they would communicate with me in 5-10 business days when this correction would be made. 10 business days came and went, I didn't receive any communication. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told I was on the SAVE repayment plan, they just can't correct it on my account, or send me any communication because of the court injunction. They assured me that no interest would accrue, I wouldn't owe anything, and my account wouldn't be delinquent or go into default if I didn't pay anything, and that I was in the SAVE forbearance until at least XX/XX/XXXX. They said they couldn't give me a confirmation number, I just basically had to take their word for it. I received an auto-debit notification on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point I trusted them, and didn't have a chance to call with a long wait time until XX/XX/XXXX. On that call, it failed after over an hour of waiting, and I called back. I spent over XXXX hours on the phone waiting. I was connected and told that I was given misinformation on XX/XX/XXXX, that I wasn't on the SAVE plan, I was on the Standard repayment plan and I had a bill due that would auto-debit. I was furious. The customer representative could not cancel the auto-debit. They said that they can't re-process me into the SAVE plan because of the court injunction. The supervisor office was closed by the time I was connected, so they said a supervisor would call me back on XX/XX/XXXX. Over the weekend, I removed my bank from my Mohela account, or so I thought. I didn't receive a call on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and waited for 5 hours before I was connected to a "" resolution team ''. I recorded parts of the conversation because I was told they couldn't send me notes. I requested a letter summarizing their internal error and failure to put me back on the SAVE plan. they said that they can attempt to re-process me back onto the SAVE plan after XX/XX/XXXX when my forbearance ends. They also said they cancelled the auto-debit. On XX/XX/XXXX I received the callback from a supervisor from the task that was started from the XX/XX/XXXX call. They said that a letter detailing the error had been drafted and sent to me, I received it, and it does not include the admission of fault by Mohela, nor their plan for how to correct their error and put me back on the SAVE plan with interest backdated. I requested an ACH company ID so that I can issue a stop payment from them for the next 6 months on my bank, they put in that request and we scheduled a callback to ensure I get that ACH number and to review the letter. I never received a call back. I called after XX/XX/XXXX as soon as I could on XX/XX/XXXX. I spent 8 hours on the phone waiting to be connected to someone. At which point I was told I couldnt be re-processed onto the SAVE plan due to the court injunction. I was told I was on the Standard repayment plan, and my account would become delinquent if I didnt pay. I was told that I could elect to be put on a processing forbearance. There was no admittance of fault, or resolution offered for Mohelas error of putting me unauthorized onto the Standard plan, and what they were going to do to correct this error and put me back on the SAVE repayment plan. The call was dropped when they said they were going to put me in a processing forbearance, and connect me to a supervisor.

My complaint is after reviewing the AFT lawsuit, and a report put out by 50 of our Senators and Congressmen, what I have been the victim of seems like an intentional scheme to get customers on a high repayment plan. My fear is that I won't be able to be put back on the SAVE repayment plan because it will no longer be an option. I don't want to be put on a different IDR plan. I am okay with not getting credit towards PSLF at this time in exchange of continuing to be on the SAVE forbearance with no interest. I am about to go on maternity leave and do not know what my reportable income will be, and would prefer to be on the SAVE forbearance because Federal Student Aid has stated on their website that those in the SAVE repayment plan will not have to go into repayment earlier than fall XXXX, and re-certify their income no earlier than XX/XX/XXXX. I want to be back on the SAVE plan.

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, both entities have failed to address the problem, leaving me no choice but to seek your assistance. 

Key details of my complaint : 1. Loan servicer : AidvantageAidvantage Ticket Number : XXXX 2. Department of EducationFederal Student Aid Case Number : XXXX XXXX. Loan balance as of XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXCurrent loan balance : XXXX XXXXUnauthorized interest accrued : {$1300.00} 4. Issue : Interest has been incorrectly charged on my SAVE plan loans during a period of administrative forbearance when interest should not have accrued. 

Timeline and attempts at resolution : 1. Since XX/XX/XXXX, all SAVE plan borrowers were placed into interest-free administrative forbearance due to ongoing legal challenges.

2. I have made multiple attempts to resolve this issue, including four separate phone calls to Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
3. I have also submitted formal complaints to both Aidvantage and the Department of Education, as evidenced by the ticket and case numbers provided above.

4. Despite these efforts, neither Aidvantage nor the Department of Education has taken action to correct the error and remove the unauthorized interest.

5. This situation has been ongoing for several weeks with no resolution, which is unacceptable. 

The lack of response and action from both Aidvantage and the Department of Education is particularly concerning given that : 1. The Department of Education has explicitly stated that interest should not accrue during this administrative forbearance period. 
2. The current forbearance is expected to last until at least XX/XX/XXXX, or longer, pending further developments from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
3. Even outside of this specific forbearance period, the SAVE plan includes an interest subsidy where the government covers any accrued interest not covered by the borrowers monthly payment. 

I am requesting your immediate intervention to : 1. Ensure the removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized interest from my account. 
2. Restore my loan balance to {$72000.00}, as it was in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX 
3. Investigate why Aidvantage and the Department of Education have failed to address this clear violation of the SAVE plan terms and current forbearance mandates.

4. Implement measures to prevent similar issues for other borrowers in the SAVE plan.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution of this issue.

01/14/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"We have received conflicting and confusing information from the Department of Education on the process for discharging our student loans and the current status of that process. 

We consolidated our student loans with the Department of Education in XX/XX/XXXX. Because that consolidation happened before XX/XX/XXXX, our loans were placed into a process called the One-Time Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Payment Count Adjustment that looked at our past payments to get a count of how many payments qualified towards an income driven repayment process. On the StudentAid.gov website, it was stated that is the IDR Recount showed qualified payments of XXXX for undergraduate loans and XXXX for graduate loans, that the loans would automatically be discharged regardless of what our current repayment plan was. To quote from StudentAid.gov 's website ( https : //studentaid.gov/idr/ ) : "" Can I check online to see if my loans are impacted by the one-time IDR payment count adjustment? The first group of eligible borrowers were informed by ED on XX/XX/XXXX, that they have loans that qualified for forgiveness. No further action is required from these borrowers to get this forgiveness. ED will continue to identify and notify borrowers wo reach the necessary forgiveness threshold of XXXX or 300 months ' worth of qualifying payments, depending on the repayment plan and type of loan. '' Also, from the studentaid.gov website ( https : //studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-account-adjustment ) : "" Any borrowers with loans that have accumulated eligible time in repayment of at least XXXX or 25 years will see automatic forgiveness, even if they are not currently on an IDR plan. '' On XX/XX/XXXX I called the StudentAid.gov support line, and was told by an agent that the process concluded for my loans on XX/XX/XXXX. I have XXXX loans, XXXX # XXXX and # XXXX, and that both exceeded the forgiveness threshold as both had qualifying payments, at that time, of XXXX. I was also told that I needed to take no further action for that discharge to take place. I have continued to make payments on both loans while I have awaited the loan discharge from the Department of Education. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the StudentAid.gov dashboard for my loans updated. The status of the loans had not changed, but there was a link to inquire about Income Driven Repayment. Following that link for my account showed XXXX options for IDR. For a type of loan called an Income-Based Repayment, the graphic showed that I had XXXX qualifying payments, and that on on this plan my loans would be forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX, the current month. 

This seemed confusing as previous and current information on the StudentAid.gov website indicated that the loans should be forgiven without having to do anything further. I called and spoke to an agent for StudentAid.gov who informed me that contrary to what was stated on the website, I did indeed need to sign up for an IBR plan to qualify for forgiveness and to have the qualifying payments of XXXX apply. That agent transferred me to the department charged with signing people up for IBR plans, and that agent also confirmed that, contrary to what is on the StudentAid.gov website as posted above, that a person does indeed have to be signed up for an IBR plan for those qualifying payments to be counted and the loan discharged.

As a precaution, despite the confusing information, I have filled out the application for an Income-Driven Repayment plan, or Income Based Repayment plan, specifically the ICR or Income Contingent Repayment plan, as that one is not currently been put on hold due to pending litigation. 

I would like the Department of Education to follow through on their stated promise to discharge my student loan as it exceeds the minimums of XXXX and/or XXXX qualifying payments, as noted on their website and with my qualifying payments noted as part of my accounts information on qualifying for an IDR plan.",None,Servicer under contract with Federal Student Aid,OH,45140,None,Consent provided,Web,01/14/25,Untimely response,No,N/A,11526347

They are all miscalculated in terms of payment history, incorrectly asserting I began repayment in XXXX, and prolonging my payments into XXXX when the loans should be eligible for discharge.. 

I discussed this with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the manager of customer advocates. She is aware of the issue and is working to resolve the inaccuracy, but the problem originates with the Department of Education and not the servicer, so this is another effort on my end to get the source data corrected. 


These loans were taken out when I attended XXXX XXXXy and are direct loans that I started to repay 6 months after graduation in XX/XX/XXXX. The 25 year repayment XXXX was XX/XX/XXXXXXXX 


My IDR count says I have 13 years and 2 months left on repayment on these 8 loans, however. 


My backend XXXX file shows the error, saying that my repayment didn't begin until XXXX, as this example of the 8 loans miscalculated shows. 


Loan Status Description : IN REPAYMENT Loan Status Effective XXXX Loan Status : ID Loan Status Description : IN SCHOOL OR GRACE PERIOD Loan Status Effective XXXX Loan Disbursement XXXX In other words, the backend data cuts out the time between the beginning of my repayment in XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for 8 of my 10 loans.

Repayment began 6 months later as mandated by law. 


But payments made during the period from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX are omitted from the calculation, leading to the erroneous date when the loan is declared to have been satisfied.

A fair outcome would be a recalculation that encompasses all time in repayment going back to XX/XX/XXXX on those 8 loans, which was promised by the Department of Education but which is not provided on or reflected by the backend data for those 8 loans. 


Loan history is missing and it affects my IDR count before discharge on 8 of my loans taken out at XXXX XXXX between XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. Repayment on all began in XX/XX/XXXX.

Navigating the Mohela system, talking to real people at Mohela has been a tremendous task. I am put on hold, forwarded to other people, and nothing is resolved. Yesterday I called to have my loans put in forbearance as I wait for the completed count toward PSLF discharge. I waited 1 hour 10 minutes for someone to answer. I shared that I needed the forbearance while waiting for the count, she said she couldnt do that, and she would forward my call. When forwarded I received a prompt that said my wait time was 6 hours! I then hung up and went online and sent a message requesting the forbearance. 



I have emails from XXXX stating that PSLF was working with MOHELA to correct the count. I have correspondence with XXXX XXXX from Mohela stating that they are working on the count, and to be patient. It is hard to be patient when this is taking months to complete. It is difficult to move throughout the day while feeling the stress that I have now paid off ( In truth, I have overpaid ) my 120 payments.

XXXX achieved XXXX years / XXXX months of eligible employment in XX/XX/XXXX, therefore should have qualified for forgiveness. However, my payment count on the XXXX tracker on XXXX has been stuck at XXXX of XXXX payments. 
-The first XXXX months of my employment in XXXX were originally ineligible due to forbearance, so I applied for XXXX buyback in XX/XX/XXXX when I would be eligible for forgiveness to achieve XXXX payments. After applying for buyback, I did not receive any correspondence. 
-On XX/XX/XXXX, I also submitted for PSLF reconsideration and received an email from XXXX ( see below ). 
XXXX subsequently submitted multiple employment certification forms that were eventually processed and approved/ accepted, along with XXXX  reconsideration ( see attached ). 
XXXX reached back out to my servicer at XXXX to inquire about the status of my buyback application as I had waited XXXX days. I was told there was no record of my buyback submission, and it may have been due to the XXXX pause and I was instructed to resubmit my buyback application. Due to this, I submitted an ombudsman complaint to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating : "" I applied for buyback in XXXX as that is when I would have worked for XXXX months at a qualifying employer ( since XX/XX/XXXX ) and I was looking to buyback the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX as they were in forbearance / deferment.

I started another chat today ( case # : XXXX ) and they said there was no record of my request for buyback in the system and that it may have been because that was during the pause and I should resubmit the request. '' -The above complaint was ultimately closed and I was told the buyback application could not be escalated due to this error. 
XXXX reached out to XXXX again in XXXX ( XXXX ) to inquire about the status of my buyback and was still told it was open and being reviewed. 
XXXX reached out to XXXX again in XX/XX/XXXX about my buyback application and was also told it is still in review and could not be escalated. I asked for any type of documentation or correspondence to show the buyback application was received and in review ; I was asked if it was in My Documents section online and I replied No, and I was not given any documentation -I have been enrolled in the XXXX plan, therefore, the past several months have not counted towards XXXX even though now I have XXXX XXXX months of qualifying payment, exceeding and meeting the qualifications. Studentaid.gov said I could try applying for another income based plan to have months going forward count, but that is also a long process. 
-I have exhausted every avenue to try and have my payment counts updated and achieve forgiveness and I have had no luck. I applied for buyback XXXX months ago with no progress.

Misinformation About Repayment Options : When I contacted Navient to discuss difficulties in making payments, I was repeatedly advised to enroll in forbearance rather than being informed about income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) plans. I later discovered that XXXX plans would have significantly lowered my monthly payments and prevented unnecessary interest accrual. Instead, the forbearance periods caused my loan balance to grow, adding substantial interest that could have been avoided with accurate advice. Payment Mismanagement : I made payments to Navient with specific instructions to apply the payments to my highest-interest loan. Despite these instructions, the payments were misapplied across multiple loans. This not only increased the overall interest I accrued but also made it more difficult to track my loan balances and progress. Attempts to correct the payment misapplications were met with inconsistent and unhelpful responses from customer service. Lack of Transparency and Poor Customer Service : When I sought clarification on my loan terms and repayment options, Navient representatives provided conflicting information and frequently defaulted to recommending forbearance as the solution. I was not informed of other options that could have better aligned with my financial situation, such as loan consolidation or IDR plans. Financial Harm : As a result of Navients actions, I experienced unnecessary increases in my loan balance due to misapplied payments and accrued interest during forbearance periods.

The email was met with an automated reply simply stating that I had already called a customer service representative about the issue. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called MOHELA again to inquire about the status of my refund and to put a forbearance on my account. At that time, they told me the refund request was still not finalized on their end, so I asked for expedited processing.

I was told, it is under investigation, it will take 180 days. I asked why 180 days, she replied, the check was cashed, they're conducting an investigation. I waited 3 months, I didn't hear from them, I contacted Mohela in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, I was told it hasn't been 180 days. I needed to wait.

She said, don't worry, I am going to send them an email right now so that they could mail your check to you immediately. I was very happy, I thought my XXXX checks will arrive in no time. XXXX months went by, no sign of the checks. I decided to call Mohela. I called them in XXXX, someone ansered and said, "" your check was cashed, the money is gone. Our investigation is still on-going. we'll let you know as soon as we're done our investigation. I was very upset listening to the lies. I said to her, there's no such thing, you're making this up. I said to her, "" why are you guys holding my money? I am entitle to my refund from the over payments I made during the past 16 years. I let her know that I spoke with DOE director and the money wasn't stolen. She disconnected the phone on me. Two weeks later I called back, the representative said to me, "" we just mail you the first check ''. Allow 7 to 10 business days, We've sent the second check to the Treasury department for signature, as soon as we get it back from the treasury department, we will mail it to you as well. I was very happy. I checked my mailbox every day to see if it arrived. It was just another lie. In the middle of XXXX of XXXX, a couple of weeks before the election, I contacted Mohela- at that point, I knew they weren't serious, and they played the game very well. The representative whom I spoke with said to me, I am very sorry to let you know, your checks have been expired, we can't re-issue another one. The fact that you've contacted the DOE to complain about Mohela, we take the money back.

None of the prompts provided on this site described my problem, so I just selected whatever I could to reach this page where I can explain it in depth. 


Subject : Complaint Regarding Violation of XXXX Rights by the XXXX Department of Education To Whom It XXXX Concern, My name is XXXX XXXX! I am submitting this complaint regarding a violation of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( XXXX ) by the XXXX Department of Education ( XXXX ). I believe that the Department improperly disclosed my personally identifiable information ( PII ), including financial and student loan records, to unauthorized partiesspecifically to XXXX ( Department of Government Ethics ), which is not a recognized XXXX department, and to individuals affiliated with XXXX XXXX. 

This disclosure occurred without my authorization and without adherence to legally required procedures, violating FERPAs confidentiality protections. Additionally, the individual in charge of DOGE is neither an elected official nor an appointee confirmed through the proper legal process, further compounding the lack of legitimacy in their access to my records. 

Basis of My Complaint 1. Unauthorized Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information ( PII ) : FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ) strictly protects student records from disclosure without explicit, written consent. Under 34 CFR 99.30, the Department of Education must obtain my authorization before releasing any part of my educational records. I did not provide such consent. 
XXXX. XXXX is Not a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : The so-called Department of Government Ethics ( XXXX ) is not a recognized department under the XXXX government XXXX Since it lacks lawful authority, any access it had to my educational and financial records is inherently illegitimate. 
Furthermore, the person in charge of XXXX was neither elected nor properly appointed through constitutional procedures, meaning they had no lawful basis to request or receive my records. 
XXXX. Failure to Qualify for a XXXX Exception : XXXX only allows student records to be disclosed without consent under narrowly defined exceptions ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ), such as compliance with a judicial order or financial aid eligibility verification. XXXX and its affiliates do not meet any of these criteria. 
This breach is a clear violation of XXXX and the Department XXXX XXXX legal responsibility to safeguard my information. 
XXXX. Breach of Transparency Obligations & Further Unauthorized Disclosures : XXXX CFR XXXX explicitly prohibits the re-disclosure of student information without proper authorization. If DOGE or individuals associated with XXXX XXXX were allowed to access, review, or distribute my records, this constitutes an additional violation of FERPA protections.

I was never notified in advance about this data sharing, violating the Departments duty to maintain transparency and accountability regarding my private information.

Requested Resolution Given the severity of this breach and the resulting compromise of my personal and financial information, I request that you : 1. Immediately cancel and discharge my student loan debt in full as a corrective action for this privacy violation.

2. Conduct a full investigation into the Department of Educations unlawful disclosure of student records to XXXX and its affiliates. 
XXXX. Provide a written record of when, how, and why my information was accessed and disclosed, and who authorized this action. 
XXXX. Implement stronger protections to prevent similar XXXX violations from occurring in the future. 

The Department of Education failed in its legal duty to protect my private information, instead allowing it to be compromised by an unauthorized, unrecognized entity with no legal standing. This breach is unacceptable, and I urge the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) to take immediate action to address this violation. 

I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.

It should be retroactively applied to XX/XX/year> as a loan cancellation, with all interest removed. This policy was previously honored in XX/XX/year> for another disbursement repayment. However, my payment has not been applied despite being properly processed by my bank. 

Attempts to Resolve the Issue : I contacted Mohela multiple times and was informed that my payments were missing and under research. However, I was told that posting may take up to 90 days, which would put my payment outside of the 120-day cancellation window through no fault of my own.

Mohela representatives repeatedly directed me to Federal Student Aid, stating that I should dispute missing payments with them.

Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) representatives ( "" XXXX '' and another agent ) stated they could not locate the payments and redirected me back to Mohela. 

I have filed three formal complaints with FSA, yet I have not received a response explaining where my money is or when it will be properly applied. 

When I finally spoke to a Mohela representative ( "" XXXX '' ), she confirmed that my payments were missing and that this happens frequently with payments over {$1000.00}. She advised that I speak with a senior agent, but the wait time was over seven hours.

When I took out my federal student loans through Federal Student Aid ( FSA ), I was led to believe that my loan records were protected under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ), the Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ), and the Higher Education Act ( 20 U.S.C. 1087 et seq. ). However, the DOE did not disclose that my personal loan data was vulnerable to unauthorized access. 

I first learned about this issue through public news reports and legal actions, including lawsuits and Senate investigations, confirming that the DOE allowed unauthorized entities to access student loan records. Specifically : Legal actions filed by labor unions allege that DOE and FSA mishandled borrower data, allowing unauthorized access. 
Senate inquiries have raised concerns about FSAs failure to secure student loan records. 
A federal judge has blocked certain DOE data access, recognizing security risks. 

Despite the DOE 's obligation to safeguard borrower data, I was never informed that my personal loan information had been improperly accessed, nor was I given any notice of potential risks. This failure to provide complete and accurate information misled me into believing my loan data was secure when it was not. 

How This Has Harmed Me : Increased risk of identity theft due to unauthorized access to my personal information. 
Financial insecurity due to uncertainty over whether my Social Security number or other sensitive data has been compromised. 
Emotional distress and loss of trust in the DOEs ability to properly manage my student loans. 

Actions Taken : I have filed a Borrower Defense to Repayment application requesting loan discharge due to this misrepresentation and failure to disclose material information. 
I have submitted complaints with other federal agencies regarding the DOEs mishandling of borrower data. 
I am requesting CFPB oversight and intervention to hold the DOE and FSA accountable for this data security failure. 

Requested Resolution : I am formally requesting the CFPB investigate the DOEs failure to protect student loan borrower data and take action to remedy the financial and emotional harm caused to affected borrowers. Additionally, I am requesting : A full discharge of my student loans due to misrepresentation and mishandling of my personal data. 
Immediate forbearance on my loans while this matter is under investigation.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly 70,000 students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide.

XXXX. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans. 
XXXX. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.

02/04/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"Dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding Mohelas handling of my federal student loans. Despite being enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program, the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) plan, and the Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ) plan, my monthly student loan payment has been increasing by approximately {$300.00} every month without explanation. 
I have not attended school since XXXX, yet my total student loan balance continues to grow, now exceeding what I owe on my home, which I purchased in XXXX and refinanced once. This is financially unsustainable and contradicts the purpose of the PSLF and income-driven repayment programs.

Additionally, I work for a nonprofit organization that helps individuals experiencing homelessness, dedicating my career to public service. Under the PSLF program, my payments should be both stable and reflective of my income, but instead, Mohelas mismanagement is causing serious financial strain.

I have attempted to contact Mohela numerous times to resolve this issue. Each time I call, I am placed on a callback list but never receive meaningful assistance. I am unable to get clear answers about why my payments are increasing or how my balance is continuing to rise.

I am requesting the CFPB to investigate Mohelas handling of my loan, specifically : 1. An explanation for the unexplained increases in my monthly payments.

2. A review of Mohelas customer service practices, particularly their failure to provide adequate assistance.

3. A correction to my account to ensure my payments align with PSLF, SAVE, and ICR requirements. 
This situation is urgent, as these ongoing increases are financially destabilizing.

01/18/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Today XX/XX/XXXX17th I called Mohela regarding my previous complaint XXXX and to reattempt to be placed either on a processing forbearance or preferentially, on an income based repayment program. Initially, this morning I was on hold 30 minutes in which I had the option to opt for a callback. I did indeed receive a call back however when I informed them of the reason for my call ( desire to be placed in either a processing forbearance or to be placed in an income driven repayment program ) they stated that I would have to speak with someone else and that they would be happy to transfer me. That estimated wait time was 4.5 hours - I did attempt to wait this time but I could not.

Later in the afternoon I did have time to be on hold so I opted to do so. After 2 hours I did reach an agent who seemingly initially attempted to be helpful. They stated they would try and get me on a processing forbearance and that processing times for income based application processing was at least 90 days from the date of receipt but that they had received it. I noted that my account has a due date of XX/XX/year>2025 in the amount of XXXX. I noted that that payment would not count toward PSLF and that I also would struggle to afford such a high payment referring them back to my income driven application ( s ). She said that she might be able to make a request but that because I'm already on forbearance that I would possibly have to wait until that forbearance were up to request a new one. I noted to the agent that this would be on a Saturday when it ends, that is, saturday XX/XX/XXXX and that the call center for such a request would be closed. She said in this circumstance she advises not to make the payment and after the payment due date to request forbearance. I find this very uncomfortable and unsettling. She said she would make a request. 

I also noted that the payment amount due on the phone line states that I have an amount due of XXXX for which the agent did not comment on for the conversation. 

The agent noted that income driven repayment programs have been on hold until XXXX. I noted that they are not now however and I do expect what was sent to me to be honored. 

I noted that I was absolutely not comfortable missing the due date with the intent of requesting forbearance.This advice actually does indeed make me quite uncomfortable. 

I am literally in between the decision of simply missing a due date on a loan payment at their advice or hoping that they honor this request. A request that they have noted should be honored since I submitted my most recent income driven application. I am also quite confused of what amount is/could/would be due if I were to choose not to take that advice if they are unable to honor my request of being placed on processing forbearance without a willingness to simply not pay on the due date. 

I am entirely and utterly unable to financially plan. I have a relatively large account and I believe the XXXX on the phone line is an attempt to gain more money. I also have had the advice not to pay on my loan on the due date or by the due date on two separate occasions now. I do not feel at all comfortable with even receiving this advice even if well intended. It brings me even closer to default which I am already at a significant risk for in light of the large balance and interest rate which has been accruing more interest as per my previous complaint. I also believe that the due date manipulation with a weekend timing with forbearance having to end prior to the next processing forbearance is a manipulation for financial gain.

When my children ( XXXX ) went to college, I took Parent Plus loans to assist with their tuition. My older son graduated from XXXX in XXXX of XXXX, and I started to pay the loans. 
As a public-school employee, I am eligible for the PSLF program. I did everything that was asked of me. I certified my employment several times, I sent documentation as was asked to the Department of Education and to MOHELA. I consolidated my loans as I was told was necessary for reimbursement ( resulting in almost doubling my debt!!! ) My problem comes from the fact that although I was eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness in XXXX, after making XXXX payments to my loans, MOHELA and the Department of Ed are not counting my payments for my older son from XXXX. They are stating that my son was still in school at that time. 
My older son graduated in XXXX and I began to make payments on the loan. My younger son was indeed in school and I did not start paying his loan until XXXX. However, by consolidating the loans, I was informed that ALL payments to the loans would count as this was now a single loan which I started to pay in XXXX. 
I have researched this ad nauseum, and yes I am entitled to get my loan forgiven through PSLF since XXXX. I have been continuing to make payments even though my loan should be forgiven as I do not want to be considered in default and then ineligible through a loophole. They should also reimburse me for all payments made from XXXX. 
I really need help in getting the Dept. of Education and MOHELA to acknowledge and accept the payments made from XXXX on my older sons loans. I have sent them several correspondences as well as payment records and even my older sons diploma to show that he was no longer in school when I was making payments. 
Please let me know if there is anything at all you can do to help me.

3. Breach of Contract My loan servicer ( Nelnet ) and the Department of Education have a legal obligation to protect my sensitive financial data. 

4. Consumer Protection Laws If my loan data was accessed by an unauthorized third party, this could be a case of fraud or negligence. 



As a borrower, I signed a contract assuming that my loan servicer ( Nelnet ) and the Department of Education would protect my information from unauthorized access. 

If XXXX XXXX or any unauthorized entity accessed federal loan data, this could be a serious breach of confidentiality under FERPA and Privacy Act regulations. 

Any unauthorized third-party surveillance or data breach compromising my financial records creates potential for identity theft, fraud, and contract violations. 



1. Conduct a full audit of who has accessed my student loan information.

2. Provide written confirmation of whether any third-party entity has had access to my personal or financial records.

3. Explain whether my student loan servicer ( Nelnet ) has reported any data breaches regarding borrower accounts.

4. Determine whether unauthorized access qualifies for loan forgiveness due to contract violation.

5. Outline steps for corrective action to ensure that no further unauthorized access occurs.

I demand immediate investigation into this matter, as my loan servicer and the Department of Education are responsible for ensuring the security of my private data.

02/11/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I am submitting this formal complaint against EdFinancial Services, the servicer of my federal student loans, for the unauthorized disclosure of my personal and financial data to XXXX XXXX and/or his affiliated entities. 

This disclosure occurred without my consent and constitutes a clear violation of multiple federal privacy laws, including The Privacy Act of 1974, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), and The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). I seek an investigation into this matter and corrective actions to be taken by EdFinancial Services. 
XXXX. FACTUAL BACKGROUND I am a borrower with EdFinancial Services, which is responsible for servicing my federal student loan account. 
I recently became aware, through [ news reports, public statements, or other sources ], that XXXX XXXX or his affiliated companies gained access to my personal student loan data. This access occurred without my knowledge or consent and without any prior notification or request from EdFinancial Services for my authorization. 
At no point did EdFinancial Services inform me of any agreement or authorization allowing XXXX XXXX or his entities to access or utilize my sensitive financial records. 

III. LEGAL VIOLATIONS The unauthorized disclosure of my personal financial data by EdFinancial Services to third parties violates several key federal laws, including : 1. The Privacy Act of 1974 ( 5 U.S.C. 552a ) This law restricts federal agencies and contractors from disclosing personal information without the individual 's consent. The release of my loan data to XXXX XXXX and his affiliates without my authorization is a direct violation of this statute. 

2. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 6801-6827 ) The GLBA mandates that financial institutions, including loan servicers like EdFinancial Services , protect borrowers private financial information. Disclosing my student loan records to unauthorized third parties is a clear violation of this law. 

3. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ) As my student loan data is considered an educational record, it is protected under FERPA. EdFinancial Services violated my rights under FERPA by disclosing my data without my consent. 

4. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ) If my loan information was accessed by unauthorized parties and has led to changes in my credit or loan terms, this constitutes a violation of the FCRA. Loan servicers are obligated to protect consumers credit information from unauthorized access. 

IV. DAMAGES AND HARM CAUSED As a result of EdFinancial Services unlawful disclosure, I have suffered the following damages : Loss of privacy due to the unauthorized release of my sensitive student loan data. 
Risk of identity theft as my personal and financial information may have been misused by unauthorized third parties. 
Emotional distress and anxiety from the violation of my personal privacy and the uncertainty about what happened to my data. 
Potential financial harm if this disclosure resulted in altered loan terms or a negative impact on my credit report. 

V. DEMAND FOR RELIEF To address this matter, I request the following from EdFinancial Services and related parties : Immediate disclosure of the specific data that was disclosed, the timeline of access, and the identities of all third parties ( including XXXX XXXX and affiliated entities ) who gained access to my information. 
A formal revocation of access granted to XXXX XXXX and his affiliated entities, and a cessation of any further unauthorized access to my personal loan data. 
A thorough investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) into this unauthorized disclosure by EdFinancial Services. 
Monetary compensation for damages incurred, including emotional distress, loss of privacy, and potential financial harm. 
Corrective action, including a review of EdFinancial Services ' security protocols and their adherence to federal privacy laws, to ensure no further unauthorized disclosures occur. 

VI. CONCLUSION Failure to act upon this claim will result in my pursuing further legal action, including joining any class-action lawsuits or seeking additional remedies through the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) , the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , and the Department of Education .

I have been repaying my student loans without issue up until the XXXX transition and ultimately the XXXX injunction. Since then, my XXXX count has been deemed ineligible despite documentation and reassurance from Mohela and XXXX XXXX that this would not impact forgiveness programs ( attached file ). My application for forgiveness has absolutely been impacted and neither Mohela or XXXX XXXX are taking steps to quickly rectify this for millions of people who are now in limbo. At the direction of Student Aide, I submitted an application to move into a new XXXX plan on XX/XX/XXXX in order to continue receiving credit for XXXX. I was also informed via XXXX XXXX that credit would be given for 60 days due to processing forbearance ( attached file ) .During multiple calls attempted, I was informed by Mohela XXXX a processing forbearance should have been applied to the account as described above. Upon contact Mohela to address this, representatives stated that those on XXXX did not qualify for a prcessing forbearance. I then asked where this exclusion was outlines on the website or correspondence and none of ther representative could verify that the public was informed of this, therby preventing consumers from making fully educated decisions on how to move forward with their loan repayment options I subsequently submitted reconsideration requests on XX/XX/XXXX to count the Mohela transition as eligible per Mohela- immediately denied with generic response that did not pertain to my situation ; XX/XX/XXXX I re-submitted a new PSLF reconsideration count- no response received as of XX/XX/XXXX ; and submitted a request for buyback on XX/XX/XXXX identifying the months that should have been deemed eligible, which includes a processing forbearance that should have been applied to the account for XXXX and XXXX no response received as of XX/XX/XXXX. I've contacted both agencies numerous times ( XXXX total with several over hours of waiting- attached file of some calls ) between the dates of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX regarding the status of my requests and ultimately told i needed to wait. On XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by a Mohela Representative that they never received my XXXX application despite the XXXX website confirming that it had been sent XX/XX/XXXX and was in review ( attached file ). The representative shared that they received the taxes attached to the application but not the application portion, therefore I would need to submit a new application. At no time previously was this shared after waiting over three and a half months to have this processed. I was told the new application would then be sent to the back of the que as applications are processed in order, therefore the three-and-a-half-months wait was all for nothing. I then contacted XXXX XXXX and spoke with a representative that indicated that the application was sent to Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX and that I will need to send a new application if they claim they did not receive it. I ultimately requested to file a complaint so that Mohela and XXXX XXXX could rectify this situation and hold the agencies accountable. The woman ultimately disconnected the call and sent me back to the automated menu without the ability to speak with someone to file a complaint. At this time, there has been no progress made on my attempts to hold either agency accountable for their lack of professionalism and transparency. What is happening to me and millions of others, isn't being talked about and as a result, Mohela and Federal Student Aide continue to fail, misinform, and avoid accountability regarding the negative impact their significantly inadequate services have caused.

01/22/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am a federal student loan borrower with MOHELA as my loan servicer. I am currently on the SAVE repayment plan and stuck in the SAVE general forbearance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to the PAYE repayment plan on the Federal Student Aid website, and MOHELA communicated to me in writing on XX/XX/XXXX that they received my PAYE application. Pursuant to the FSA website, "" If servicers need time to process a borrower 's IDR [ e.g., PAYE ] application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. '' As clarified further in a XX/XX/XXXX email sent by FSA to borrowers on the SAVE plan, "" If you submit an application to enroll in an IDR plan other than SAVE, but your loan servicer is unable to process your application within XXXX business days of receiving the application or before your next billing statement will be sent, you will be moved into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. '' Based on my XX/XX/XXXX application date, the XXXX business day would have been XX/XX/XXXX. I should have been moved from the SAVE general forbearance onto a 60-day processing forbearance on or before XX/XX/XXXX if MOHELA was unable to move me from SAVE to PAYE. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I remain on the XXXX plan and in a general SAVE forbearance. 

A copy of the XX/XX/XXXX email is attached. 

I have communicated with MOHELA numerous times since my XX/XX/XXXX application. Some MOHELA representatives acknowledge that a processing forbearance should be applied. Others, including one from a call today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) assert that borrowers on a SAVE general forbearance are prohibited from being moved to a 60-day processing forbearance, and that this prohibition comes directly from FSA. I informed MOHELA reps of the XX/XX/XXXX FSA email and FSA website language, but refuse to acknowledge the very plain instructions that SAVE borrowers are eligible for a 60-day processing forbearance if they apply to another IDR plan like PAYE.

I have communicated to FSA, who say forbearances are handled by MOHELA. Both MOHELA and FSA point to each other as the problem, causing irreparable harm to borrowers.

I also believe I have been missing interest rate discounts. This has been going on since I changed bank accounts in XX/XX/XXXX. After my last phone call with Mohela, they suggested that I refrain from re-enrolling in auto payments since they say it takes XXXX billing cycles for auto-payment to go into effect. I have done that and auto-payments still are not being processed. Most recently, an automatic payment that was due XX/XX/XXXX was not processed automatically. 

The following is correspondence from myself to XXXX. The XXXX XXXX XXXX. closed my case on XX/XX/XXXX with no resolution : Case Information Date Submitted XX/XX/XXXX Category Repaying My Aid Subcategory Dealing with XXXX XXXXrvicer Case Description Auto payment was debited on XX/XX/XXXX from a checking account that I no longer use instead of my new checking account. Payment went delinquent due to insufficient funds. New login to Mohela was required to be set up since they transitioned to a new loan servicing platform. My new checking account was not listed in the auto payment after setting up the new login. I can not reach any customer service representative at Mohela to resolve this in a reasonable amount of time because wait times on the phone have been up to an hour long with no option for a call back. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX have email confirmations of auto pay enrollment dated XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and today, XX/XX/XXXX. No automatic payments have successfully been been processed on time since then. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX received another past-due email notification. Auto-payment was not processed again. XXXX was due on XX/XX/XXXX and I made a manual payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I also re-enrolled in auto-payment. Since I've enrolled with the new bank account, every payment has been missed on the due date. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX Another payment was missed on the date it was due despite verifying having been enrolled in automatic payment after calling Mohela last month. Another one-time payment was made today, and auto-payment was re-enrolled. This is now a persistent issue. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  Another payment that was due on XX/XX/XXXX was not processed on-time even though the new Mohela XXXX on XXXX stated that the amount due would automatically be debited on the due date. I also ensured that my old checking account had sufficient funds. I manually made the payment today XX/XX/XXXX. The Mohela portal still says that a payment is scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX from my old checking account. There are more than sufficient funds in both my old and new accounts. This is now 2 payments that I am not sure will qualify towards PSLF forgiveness because they were not processed automatically on their scheduled due dates. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX  After an hour on hold with Mohela, they did confirm that my payment was processed and would not be reported to credit bureaus. However the representative stated that only XXXX XXXX XXXX could validate that the payment would be credited towards qualifying PSLF payments. Furthermore, they informed me that my new account would not take effect for 2-3 billing cycles and I would have to make payments manually until then. When I asked if being forced to make manual payments would cost me the 0.25 % interest rate discount for auto payment, they said that it unfortunately would until automatic payments took effect. This does not strike me as a fair business practice compared to most automatic billing agreements.

01/28/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"At the beginning of COVID, I was informed that making payments and being on the forbearance would count twice for the time period towards PSLF forgiveness. In XXXX XXXX, MOHELA advised differently and I requested a refund of all payments made to both of my loans. I followed up by phone on a regular basis and was told it's a process and to be patient. The first payment was received XX/XX/XXXX and separate checks continued up until XX/XX/XXXX. There has not been any money returned since those last checks. 

The amount outstanding is {$11000.00} based on my calculations. During the last year, I have continued to contact MOHELA requesting the remaining amount and it has been a circle that has yet to receive an outcome. The hours spent on the phone, sending emails, providing the requested documentation has been a consistent waiting game. Then when I do get to talk to someone, that conversation does not yield anything better. I have to explain the situation over and over to each new person answering the call, wait while they read up on the history, then to be told I need to speak to a supervisor. I get transferred and voice mail picks up EVERY time. I leave a voice mail, wait for return call which has only occurred once. I understand their 'business hours ' are also my business hours ; but I make myself available, pausing from my job. 

I sent an request to the Ombudsman last year and did not hear anything, not even acknowledgement of my complaint. I have voiced my complaints, frustration, and time spent on this topic repeatedly to MOHELA to not receive any acknowledgement or urgency or consistency. 

During COVID, the loans were at different servicers. MOHELA continues to tell me that they can not refund money not paid to them ; yet they did refund some payments made to a few of the servicers, just not all. The time I was making payments to XXXX seems to be outstanding amounts. I have sent in bank statements, I contacted XXXX myself and they provided the history to me which I then gave to MOHELA. And then had to give them again when they moved to a new system. At times MOHELA has explained it is FSA holding up the amount, then at another time, it's because the payments were made at another servicer. How the story can keep changing is beyond my grasp.

The amount owed is not a few hundred dollars, even if it was - it is still owed to me. My loans continue to be in good standing, making payments ahead of scheduled due dates. The other issues I've experienced with MOHELA are small in size compared to this amount outstanding. How my current payments are applied do not make sense since the increase to my loans was before I received the refund. When I mentioned it to a representative at MOHELA, they assured me that recalculation would occur once all refunds are received.

01/08/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"For the past 6 months, since the court injunction that blocked certain aspects of the XXXX plan, XXXX and XXXX have been misleading student loan borrowers about the state of their accounts and their options for remedy. I understand that the transition of XXXX administration from XXXX to XXXX caused a backlog, but it is not acceptable for a company that controls such an important part of their customers to be so poorly managed. Misleading and confusing letters and website information, tech glitches, and long wait times for customer service are the hallmark not just of XXXX ( as is already well documented ), but also XXXX. I have two issues that have remained unresolved for months. 

ISSUE XXXX : XXXX XXXX & XXXX My payment date is the XXXX of the month. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a full payment ( Exhibit A ). I had been told that a forbearance was coming because of XXXX platform transition and that it would count toward XXXX, but it never showed in my account and my account had already transitioned by my due date, XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit B ). 

In XXXX I submitted an Employment Certification Form, and at that time my payment count was updated on the XXXX website. However, the month of XXXX was not included. The list of months included XXXX ( qualifying ), XXXX ( ineligible ), and XXXX ( ineligible ). 

In XXXX, after XXXX updated the system, XXXX appeared in the list, but it was marked ineligible due to a forbearance on my due date. I called XXXX to question this, and I was told to file a reconsideration request. I did so on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit C ). 

It is worth noting that hundreds of people in the XXXX XXXX support group and XXXX subreddits have also experienced this problem. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have not gotten a response to my reconsideration request. 

ISSUE 2 : Legality of the XXXX XXXX XXXX by Dept. of Ed. 
I have been told by XXXX that the XXXX has told them to pause processing the XXXX applications of borrowers currently on the XXXX plan. IBRs calculation has never been part of the injunction, and stalling my XXXX application interferes with my statutorily delegated ability to switch my repayment plans. Additionally, there has been no official transparency on the matter. None of this has been communicated to borrowers and in fact numerous misleading statements can be currently found on various XXXX websites. Here is my situation. 

When I and all other borrowers on the XXXX plan were forced into forbearance because of the court injunction, XXXX said there were XXXX remedies for people in PSLF ( Exhibit D, screenshot of XXXX website. ) Either borrowers could buy back the months when they hit 120 months of qualifying employment, or they could enroll in a different repayment plan. I decided to enroll in a new repayment plan. I had been on XXXX for almost all of my student loan repayment, and unfortunately I moved to the XXXX plan in XX/XX/XXXX to try and keep my costs down for my final year of repayment. 

XXXX reinforced this notion about applying for a new XXXX plan in a letter they sent on XX/XX/XXXX ( Exhibit E ). 

When the online IDR application opened again in XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately applied for XXXX ( Exhibit F ). At no point was I advised that processing was paused, which should have been a standard response to submitting an application. The solutions to the XXXX forbearance for XXXX borrowers still suggested switching plans. 

According to the XXXX website ( Exhibit D again ), If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for XXXX  and XXXX forgiveness. This was never done in my case, and in fact when I contacted XXXX, several levels of employees were unable to understand this idea, despite waiting XXXX hours per call to be escalated. This should have happened in XXXX, giving me 2 at least 2 additional months of XXXXeligible payments. 

The insult added to all of this injury is that wait times with XXXX are typically over XXXX hours, questions are met with canned responses that dont make sense and send borrowers into illogical loops, and no one is able to answer anything ( Exhibits H.1, H.3 ).",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,VA,22202,None,Consent provided,Web,01/09/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11424427

01/05/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"MY INITIAL COMPLAINT/BACKGROUND : The short ( er ) story is that I started repaying my XXXX loans in XXXX when rules were very different than today. I then attended graduate ( law school ) from XXXX, and again, started repaying my loans. XXXX became an option in XXXX and I consolidated my loans hoping to get forgiveness because I started working for the government. Due to a variety of circumstances ( unemployment, underemployment, divorce ), my loans went to forbearance multiple times and changed providers ( I also didn't know that this would re-start any XXXX repayment outside XXXX because it XXXX never told to me, or drastically change my interest rates ). I tried XXXX again with a new job which didn't work out. I then tried graduate school again to dig out from under-employment. My loans were deferred during my second round of graduate school ( and at the time, Direct Loans showed that I'd need a job paying approximately $ XXXX to pay off my loans timely! ). After the second round of graduate school, I was unemployed from late XXXX - early XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me I'd used up my forbearance allowances and defaulted my loans- despite me having no income- when they could've put me in {$0.00} or $ 5 monthly payments ( common now ) - and proof of no income ( no tax returns filed ). It resulted in tax refunds and my pittance of a paycheck being garnished when I started working again in XXXX all because of XXXX XXXX refusal to give me {$0.00} or {$5.00} payments. Another try at XXXX from XXXX working for the federal government, but we were on a student loan pause and I paid off other debts, and then Direct Loans/Mohela DENIED my XXXX because I couldn't get former XXXX employers to sign the needed forms. They refused copies of my XXXX and e-OPF to prove federal employment. ( The IRS has no records past 10 years, so I am unable to even get XXXX forms before XXXX and I no longer have those documents due to changes in computers over the years. ) I had no way to go back to federal agencies I no longer worked at to get signatures. 
****** Mohela said the only thing acceptable was paystubs, which I didn't have, and no access to the government systems to get them. I'd calculated approximately XXXX of eligible XXXX payments. I gave up and left federal employment because I couldn't keep being under-employed if Mohela refused to accept my XXXX  or XXXX as proof of eligible federal employment for loan forgiveness. Now, Mohela and XXXX refuse to give me payment counts to tell me how many months I have left to pay. I have proof I was unemployed from late XXXX - early XXXX ( no income = no tax returns filed those years but uneligible for unemployment because I was out of the country ) and should never have been negatively defaulted on my student loan history ( which will affect overall eligibility for forgiveness ). 
****** I also have been denied a payment count multiple times despite complaints to Mohela and XXXX to know how much longer I may have paying and have to work well past retirement age. I have filed multiple complaints with StudentAid.gov to no avail ( no response given other than a canned form response that they're looking into it ). I have received NO ANSWER from Mohela despite multiple requests to know why only the unsubsidized loans were put into forbearance from XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX with no reply or explanation. I can't sit on hold for XXXX or more a day trying to find out. I filed for help with my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX to no avail- they only told me to apply for XXXX. I was already on XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. If XXXX goes away ( likely ), the proposed payments sent by Mohela exceed my current New York XXXX rent. I will be homeless. Mohela has sent me XXXX repayment schedule changes since XXXX- and sent XXXX alone in XX/XX/XXXX ( I have attached the most recent ). 
****** I want a payment count of how many payments I've made and have left for forgiveness AND I want my XXXX eligibility recalculated as I have proof of federal and non-profit employment from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and again from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, my default cured/removed from my record because I was unemployed late XXXX - early XXXX and was denied {$0.00} or {$5.00} payments, and a correct and accurate timeline for payoff and/or forgiveness given. I also want all my statements from MOHELA from XXXX XXXX XXXX and an explanation as to WHY my subsidized loan was in forbearance those months ( but the unsubsidized portion was not ). 

****** First, their generic response took 60 days and is clearly a cut and paste reply doesn't address any of the questions or issues above and doesn't recognize that I have tried repeatedly to appeal the XXXX XXXX, among many other issues : ****** Dear XXXX XXXX : MOHELA has reviewed your complaint made with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) regarding your qualifying payment count toward XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ). Beginning XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( PSLF ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX programs are no longer managed through a designated loan servicer. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX XXXX is fully managed by the XXXX Department of Education on XXXX. Borrowers seeking XXXX can submit XXXX forms, track the status of their forms, view correspondence, and access payment counts through their XXXX account. If you disagree with your qualifying payment count toward XXXX, you have the option to file a reconsideration request to initiate XXXX re-review of your loan history at XXXX XXXX XXXX Please note that MOHELA is unable to either determine or expedite the qualification of payment periods for XXXX. If you have any other questions or concerns, please dont hesitate to contact a member of our Customer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX to XXXX Mondays, XXXX to XXXX Tuesdays and Wednesdays, or XXXX to XXXX Thursdays and Fridays, Central Standard Time. You can also visit XXXX. Sincerely, MOHELA ****** Second, I have previously complained about MOHELA 's response to my XXXX count. They ( at the time ) stated I was ineligible because they would only accept PAYCHECK STUBS OR XXXX statements from employers ( even the IRS no longer has the information because it is older than 10 years ) and required an employer signature ( which I am no longer able to get because I no longer work at those companies ). They REFUSE TO ACCEPT XXXX OR XXXX ( proof of federal employment ) which is ironic as they are agents of the federal government. 
****** XXXX, they have refused to provide an official, accurate payment count. I have asked repeatedly, and they publicly stated a count would be provided in XX/XX/XXXX, then delayed it until XX/XX/XXXX, and again delayed it until XX/XX/XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. At no time have they provided an accurate payment count. 
****** XXXX, I found a way to access an "" unofficial '' payment count from XXXX. If correct, it indicates the substantial subsidized portion of my loan under the XXXX XXXX plan is eligible for forgiveness. If this is correct, why has this portion of my loan NOT BEEN FORGIVEN? Is this why MOHELA had the subsidized portion of my loan in forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX? 
****** XXXX, they have refused to provide old statements from XX/XX/XXXX- XX/XX/XXXX to me and the statements are no longer available on the website as they re-did their website in XX/XX/XXXX and information and older information is no longer available. 
****** MOHELA continues to lie, deceive, and delay information and only provides half-information and half-truths to borrowers, myself included, as it is apparent they are even avoiding the complaint I have filed by not answering completely and only providing a scripted canned response to one of many issues.

The response from ED financial on XXXX is unacceptable and does not address any of the issues in my complaint. They say nothing about refunding the interest that accrued during the time they had my loans in the hardship forbearance ( accrued interest ) instead of the SAVE forbearance ( no interest ). Particularly disturbing is the response stating they will indeed expect a monthly payment that is more than I earn in a month beginning this XXXX unless I recertify for the SAVE program. There is no way I have seen on the department of education website to reapply for SAVE. Once you have it you have it, there is nothing about having to recertify periodically for SAVE. This is the response from ED financial, I make XXXX an hour and my monthly payment if SAVE goes away will be more than I make in a month I will be filing another complaint. From ED financial : Based on your account your monthly installment would increase to {$2100.00} beginning XX/XX/XXXX if recertification was not submitted to remain on the SAVE plan. from my original complaint : My student loans that are over 30 years old with an original principle of {$39000.00} are on the SAVE plan and the servicer is ED Financial. In XXXX of XXXX I worked with ED Financial to put these in forbearance since I could not make the payments.

On XXXX ED Financial told me over the phone that this is a mistake and that they will fix this, but they would not provide anything in writing. Additionally, on XXXX they sent me a repayment schedule for the IDR plan that does not make any sense. This repayment schedule has me paying {$68.00} for 5 months. Then it goes up to {$2100.00} a month after that for the next 18 months, then varying amounts per month after that. I only make {$18.00} an hour 29 hours a week.

01/17/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","Dear U.S. Department of Education and MOHELA, I am writing to formally address a significant issue regarding the incorrect Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) payment count reflected in my account. As of XX/XX/year>, the statement attached to this message shows that I had XXXX qualifying PSLF payments. However, as of today, my PSLF payment count is showing only XXXX qualifying payments. 

Given that I earn XXXX qualifying payment each month, this discrepancy is concerning. Based on my payment history, I should have exceeded XXXX qualifying payments by now, yet my account shows only XXXX as of today. This indicates that the payment count is not being updated accurately and does not reflect my true progress toward loan forgiveness under the PSLF program.

This issue is of great importance to me as I have made timely payments under the correct repayment plan and have been dedicated to fulfilling the necessary criteria to achieve forgiveness. I rely on the accurate tracking of these payments to ensure that my loans are forgiven in a timely manner. I am requesting an immediate review and correction of my PSLF payment count, as well as a full explanation of how this discrepancy occurred and the steps that will be taken to correct it. 

I would appreciate it if you could expedite this process, as this delay in accurate payment tracking is causing unnecessary confusion and stress. Please confirm the receipt of this complaint and provide me with a timeline for when I can expect the issue to be resolved. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution.

During these 60 days, time spent working will be counted towards public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ). I want my time spent working to count towards PSLF.

"" If servicers need time to process a borrowers XXXX application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days.

02/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Background : My original loan of approximately {$35000.00} began in XXXX and has now grown to {$230000.00}. Throughout the life of this loan, I have never received any other financial aid and have never been in default. I entered XXXX in XXXX and have never missed a payment since entering XXXX, except during the XXXX pause. 

Loan Issue : In XXXX, I was advised to consolidate my loans to bring me closer to forgiveness, as more months would qualify. Consequently, I consolidated my loans, but at that time, payment counts were not available for me to verify which payments qualified. 
Prior to consolidation, I attended graduate school at XXXXXXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX and was placed in an in-school deferment without my knowledge or consent. I did not receive any financial aid during this time. Additionally, I have been informed that I was in school from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; however, I am unaware of which school this refers to. I am unable to reach out to this institution that is being referenced as to why I was put in deferment. 
I have been employed full-time with a XXXX XXXX since XXXX and have made XXXX qualifying payments under an eligible repayment plan. 
Mohela provided me with an in-school deferment waiver, which I signed and returned. It was approved to waive my in-school deferment. Before the pause, I spoke with multiple representatives who assured me that I was good to retire, as I had planned to do that summer, and that my payment counts would update over the summer, reflecting that I had met the XXXX requirement for XXXX forgiveness. After the pause, my loans transferred to XXXX XXXX and are no longer with Mohela. XXXX says they can not help me because this happened prior to them being my servicer. 
I retired on XX/XX/XXXX under the belief that I had the qualifying XXXX payments, as I was repeatedly assured by Mohela. However, after the payment count update, my in-school deferment periods prior to consolidation were still not included. I was informed that this was due to those periods occurring before my consolidation. This was contrary to the information I had received from Mohela. Had I been provided with accurate information, I could have delayed my retirement and continuing working for my qualified employer until my loans were forgiven. 
I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and facing the reality of carrying this loan for the remainder of my life, or come out retirement due to misinformation. I was not required to consolidate my loans, and Mohela 's misleading guidance led me to make a decision that has negatively impacted my financial future.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,LA,711XX,None,Consent provided,Web,02/07/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11959035

Because they have delayed in processing, I am still required to make monthly payment to Mohela. 

I not only submitted multiple PSLF forgiveness applications dating back to XXXX and XXXX, but I submitted buyback requests and reconsideration requests that were IGNORED and closed without any response. I made a payment in XX/XX/XXXX that DEPT OF ED is ignoring and not counting because of some arbitrary rule they made up, DESPITE THAT MY PAYMENT WAS MADE BEFORE THEY ENTERED EVERYONE INTO AN INVOLUNTARY FORBEARANCE. 

Despite that, I have persisted. I made my # XXXX no later than XX/XX/XXXX if the XX/XX/XXXX was counted. Regardless, I made yet another payment for XX/XX/XXXX, just so I could be finished. That STILL hasn't processed and now I have a XX/XX/XXXX payment due in LITERALLY 7 DAYS. 

To avoid that, I have to be in a forbearance. I have repeatedly requested forbearance, which has been ignored. 

Not only is the Dept of Ed taking too long to process applications, but a large part of the problem is that MOHELA is not accurately and timely reporting payment histories to the Dept of Ed. 

When I attempted to call Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX for a processing Forbearance to avoid paying months I do not owe, I sat on hold for over two hours before I was abruptly hung up on. I had to call back, whereupon I was told it would be ANOTHER 97 minutes before my turn in line ( after they hung up on me and lost my place in line ). I requested them to initiate a callback and they did not call back. 

In the meantime, my application sits ignored, even though I should have been forgiven in XXXX.

I first spoke to a representative who was unable to help me and transferred me to some sort of advanced representative. I was placed on another long hold.

I read it and stated that there is no rule or regulation that prevents me from entering a processing forbearance. The advanced representative placed me on another lengthy hold and connected me with a dispute resolution XXXX. 
The dispute resolution XXXX did not state that there was a rule or regulation preventing me from being put on a processing forbearance. Instead, the dispute resolution XXXX stated that I couldnt be put on a processing forbearance because Mohela had not received guidance from the Department of Education and/or XXXX  on whether they could start processing XXXX applications for borrowers in XXXX XXXX I stated that according to the Department XXXX XXXX website, https : XXXX, as of XX/XX/XXXX, Borrowers who do not want to be in this forbearance can contact their servicer to change repayment plans.

XXXX for XXXX ( formerly known as XXXX XXXX applications and applications where borrowers checked lowest monthly payment will remain paused. Borrowers should check back here for updates. If servicers need time to process a borrowers XXXX application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance is eligible for XXXX and XXXX forgiveness. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward XXXX or XXXX until their application is processed.

02/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Mohela customer service has made it nearly impossible to correct issues with my parent plus loans. 

-I hired a 3rd party company to manage my parent loans and 3 kids student loans as the rules and requirements became too complex for a non-expert.

-proper paperwork was filled out to allow them to act as my surrogate for the loans.

-paperwork was submitted and payments were supposed to start early last year.

-Mohela calculation was wrong due to me retiring in that time. We estimate an approximate {$400.00} per month error. Appropriate paperwork was filled out.

-Notified by Mohela of a forbearance being put into place -On XX/XX/year> I was notified by Mohela that my forbearance would end in 45 days. Still new estimate on completion of my re-calculation. 

-A new forbearance was requested for XXXX through XX/XX/year> as it is only allowed for two months at a time. ( Even though I believe it should have been automatic since I was still waiting for their delay ) -On XX/XX/year> I was informed that my payment for XXXX was overdue. Although I had submitted a longer term forbearance, I was told it would take 90 days to process and I would have to call directly to Mohela to have a 2 month forbearance go into effect immediately and not be late in payments. 

-myself and the third party company spent hours waiting online to speak with a Mohela representative. Once the third party got through, they then called me to be on the line as required by Mohela. We did the same thing for XXXX and XXXX. 

-Received a message that my next payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. We contacted Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX. There was a multi-hour wait to speak to a representative. Once we did speak to a representative, we were told that we were currently under a forbearance through the remainder of XX/XX/XXXX and I would have to contact them the next day to request another forbearance. We waited another few hours and talked with a person who then forwarded us to another part of Mohela with another multi-hour wait. 

-Two weeks ago, I received another late payment notice because the 60 day forbearance had expired. Another longer term forbearance was submitted with the proper forms to Mohela. The response back was that it will take 90 days to process. That would put me nearly 5 payments behind. ( Still no progress on the relcalculation submitted nearly a year ago. 

-Third party is now not allowed to call them, so I have to call and wait on the line for the phone forbearance. Contacted them on XXXX. Was told by recording that there would be a 2 hour wait. Waited on the line for 3 hours and 33 minutes and someone answered and confirmed my information for billing purposes and told me I was late on my payment. I explained what I needed and she understood and transferred me to another Mohela department. The recording said it would be at least another 3 hour wait time on hold. At that point I could be on the phone for another 3 hours. I then called today ( XXXX ) just before XXXX and was told it would be a 2 hour wait. I chose the callback option which was not offered the day before. After selecting that option a recording said the wait time was 2 hours. It is now 6 hours later with no call. Once they do call, I will have to repeat being transferred and be on hold for multiple hours again. 

-A second IDR recalculation request was made in XXXX for the recalculation. 

-It currently shows that I owe {$16000.00} more than I did when this all started because of compounding interest that supposedly is going to be corrected at some point. 

While I understand the changes that are taking place. All of the recording messages from Mohela say they are a dept collector. A situation has been created that makes it impossible to stay above water with this thing and not be delinquent, even though they are a contractor with the government to manage these loans. Not only do I think their actual rules are not being followed, I feel there is willful delay tactics and potential fraud occurring with Mohela and these loans. 

In addition to filing complaints with multiple organizations, I have also contacted my Senators and Representatives with this same information as I believe it is either intentional or extremely poor management by Mohela and I am the ultimate recipient of those failures. Not only have I kept all correspondences on this matter, but the 3rd party I hired has also saved their documents.

The Bureau found that Edfinancial violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act by engaging in deceptive acts and practices. Edfinancial is on record via CFPB stating and quote regarding the student loan account we service for you on behalf of the U.S.

Department of Education ( the Department ).

That violates FDCPA 15 U.S.C 1692e ( 1 ) by falsely representing or implying that Edfinancial are affiliated with the United States of America.

Edfinancial is a loan servicer which in fact is a third party individual company that has no ownership nor common control by the U.S. Department of education.

15 U.S. Code 1692f - Unfair practices A debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : 15 U.S. Code 1692e ( 12 ) - False or misleading representations ( 12 ) The false representation or implication that accounts have been turned over to innocent purchasers for value.

15 U.S. Code 6809 - Definitions ( 5 ) Nonaffiliated third party The term "" nonaffiliated third party '' means any entity that is not an affiliate of, or related by common ownership or affiliated by corporate control with, the financial institution, but does not include a joint employee of such institution.

Edfinancial, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX are not affiliates of the U.S Department of Education nor are they "" bureaus. The only true credit bureau is the CFPB and they DO NOT furnish consumer reports as stated in federal law. I have a right to privacy and Per the Privacy Act of 1974 as a federally protected consumer I am now revoking any and all authorization I the consumer may have given the U.S. Department of Education written, non written, verbal, and nonverbal per 5 U.S. Code 552a. Per the FCRA as a federally protected consumer. I am now opting out of any and all authorization I the consumer may have given you XXXX, non written, verbal, and non verbal per 15 USC 6802. I shall also point out their responsibility pursuant 15 U.S. Code section Students ' financial records are confidential in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ). FERPA is a federal law that protects the privacy of student education records, including financial record. So your company can not take my nonpublic personal information and furnish it on a public forum like XXXX XXXX and XXXX for everyone to see. 
The confidentiality of my nonpublic personal information is very important and prohibited by federal laws. FERPA protects the privacy of students ' education records, FERPA prohibits the disclosure of personally identifiable information without the student 's consent.

The records covered by FERPA Financial aid applications Student account information Federal work-study payroll records Cost of attendance information Financial aid history information Documentation of professional judgment decisions 15 U.S. Code 1692k ( a ) AMOUNT OF DAMAGES Except as otherwise provided by this section, any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person is liable to such person in an amount equal to the sum of.

By taking nonpublic personal information and attempting to collect a debt you have no legal right too and that I clearly dont owe and making a false statement and furnishing a consumer report is a direct violation that goes against the FDCPA AND FDCPA.

15 usc 1692j furnishing certain deception forms ( a ) It is unlawful to design, compile, and furnish any form knowing that such form would be used to create the false belief in a consumer that a person other than the creditor of such consumer is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect a debt such consumer allegedly owes such creditor, when in fact such person is not so participating.

According to 15 U.S.C. ( the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, FDCPA ), a debt collector does not have the legal right to a debt itself ; instead, the law outlines specific restrictions on how a debt collector can attempt to collect a debt, prohibiting them from using abusive, deceptive, or unfair practices to do so.

Key points about 15 U.S.C. and debt collectors : No inherent right to the debt. The law does not grant debt collectors ownership of the debt ; they are only allowed to try to collect it on behalf of the original creditor, following specific guidelines like common ownership or control, not third party debt collectors.

Prior Written Consent to Disclose the Students Records a student must provide written consent before an education agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from the students education records. The written consent must state the purpose of the disclosure, specify the records that may be disclosed, identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure may be made, and be signed and dated.

15 U.S. Code 6801 - Protection of nonpublic personal information ( a ) Privacy obligation policy It is the policy of the Congress that each financial institution has an affirmative and continuing obligation to respect the privacy of its customers and to protect the security and confidentiality of those customers nonpublic personal information.

A service provider is any person or entity that receives, maintains, processes, or otherwise is permitted access to customer information by providing services directly to your school.

01/24/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem with your payment plan,"I consolidated my loans for PSLF purposed on XX/XX/XXXX. Mohela received my consolidated loans including an IDR request on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, XXXX. Since their receipt of my consolidated loans my account has had a pending IDR request for the SAVE repayment plan that was an option at that time. Despite filing this request in XXXX, Mohela never processed the IDR application, so my loans have been in limbo. They were not classified as SAVE nor placed in a SAVE forbearance because Mohela did not process my XXXX IDR application prior to the XXXX court stay. Since XXXX, my loans have been in a non-SAVE forbearance. This forbearance was extended in XXXX. I requested a processing forbearance to reflect that I had a pending IDR application; however, I never received any final confirmation about what type of forbearance my loans were placed in despite numerous calls and complaints. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a new IDR application through the Dept. of Ed. requesting a non-SAVE IDR payment plan, so that I can resume accruing PSLF qualifying payments. The application went through and I received confirmation at the time of application that my IDR request was forwarded to MOHELA for processing. When I filed the IDR application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were still in the unknown type of forbearance. In the application I requested that my loans be taken out of that forbearance once the IDR application is processed. I also understand, after years of managing my student loans and always completing IDR applications, that when a Servicer receives a new or updated IDR application, that the Servicer automatically places the loans in a processing forbearance until the new IDR application is processed. I know this not only from experience, but the IDR application itself states this will happen upon receipt of the IDR application. 

Unbeknownst to me, apparently Mohela processed my XXXX IDR request in early XXXX pursuant to my account information on Federal Student Aid. This early XXXX processing never appeared on my Mohela account. To date, this information does not appear on my Mohela account. I did not received any correspondence until XX/XX/XXXX, when I received a letter in my Mohela inbox entitled Your Student Loans Have Been Placed In A Forbearance. The letter indicated that my loans were placed in a SAVE forbearance. However, I did not receive any additional correspondence stating when the SAVE forbearance would start. My account online continues to show the forbearance placed in XXXX and showed that my loans are in a standard repayment plan, with the first payment due XX/XX/XXXX. My account online has never shown that my loans were placed into a SAVE forbearance. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a message in my inbox entitled Your Electronic IDR request was received. I contacted The Department of Educations Federal Student Aid and asked about the timeframes Servicers must follow regarding 1. When a Servicer must update/place student loans into a forbearance after receipt of an IDR application and 2. When a Servicer must process an IDR request. Federal Student Aid informed me that after a Servicer receives an IDR application, if they have not processed it in 10 days the Servicer must automatically place the borrowers student loans into a forbearance reflecting that a new IDR application has been received and is pending processing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice that I had a message in my Mohela inbox. The notice, which is actually dated XX/XX/XXXX states that my loans are on a standard repayment plan and the first payment will be due XX/XX/XXXX. 

As stated, I received a message in my Mohela inbox stating that Mohela received my IDR application on XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received any update about my loans being placed into forbearance that reflects my IDR request is pending processing. My account online continues to show that a payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX at the standard repayment plan amount. My account shows that my loans are in forbearance, however, this is the same forbearance my loans were placed into in XXXX, prior to the XX/XX/XXXX update that my loans were place in a SAVE forbearance. Critically, the current forbearance does not reflect either the SAVE administrative forbearance or the new forbearance that my loans should have been placed in 10 days after the receipt of my new IDR request Mohela received on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I emailed Mohela using the messaging platform on my account 's inbox/correspondence page requesting that that Mohela places my loans in the correct forbearance to reflect that there is a new pending IDR application. Mohela has not responded. Also, it is now past the 30 day processing time for Mohela to process my XX/XX/XXXX IDR application. I have not received any updates.

For reference, I have attached a copy of the IDR application page that states that Servicers will place loans into a forbearance while they are processing the IDR application, a copy of my Mohela inbox showing the limited correspondence I have received, a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX general SAVE forbearance letter, a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX receipt of IDR application letter, and the XX/XX/XXXX though uploaded on XX/XX/XXXX letter regarding my loans being on a standard repayment plan with the first payment due XX/XX/XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,GA,30030,None,Consent provided,Web,01/24/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11711599

SAVE plan application submitted on XX/XX/XXXX, 2 months before the SAVE injunction. Resubmitted a basic IDR application afterwards. MOHELA has not processed any of the applications per FSA. MOHELA is requiring borrowers to call their customer service line every 60 days for a forbearance extension. I received a letter from MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX stating that since greater than 60 days has passed since my IDR application was received and has not been processed, I would be placed in an interest free forbearance until it is processed. Granted, it had been over 6 months, no 60 days, but I digress. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I got another notification that my loans were back into repayment and not on an IDR plan. There was no notification that my plan was processed or approved/denied. Now, I am having to call back to MOHELA and the wait times are greater than XXXX hours, for which at that time, they are closed. I have called the minute they open and the morning and have been on hold until they have closed at the end of the day, where the hold line hangs up on you. All of this given that they told me it would be an estimated XXXX hour wait time, not XXXX hours. 

In the past when I've been able to get through to someone, they make you talk to a triage agent who just confirms your personal information. It can take XXXX hours to get in touch with this first person but they make no attempts to help with your issue. Then they put you on another XXXX hour hold to get to their advanced agent who can help. These tactics make it nearly impossible to get in touch with someone to have your issue resolved. 

If MOHELA is not processing applications and not allowing people to get in touch with them for forbearances, MOHELA needs to have all loan acquisitions held until they can figure out a solution to this problem that is affecting thousands of people.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,SC,29646,None,Consent provided,Web,02/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12083883

01/04/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,"Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge","Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a critical issue regarding the calculation of payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. Despite my extensive and uninterrupted service of over 13 years with XXXX XXXX XXXX , a qualified employer for PSLF, my payment count towards loan forgiveness remains incomplete.

I have diligently served as a full-time employee for more than a decade, providing essential care and support to individuals and families in need. Throughout this time, I have made consistent efforts to ensure that my payments towards student loan forgiveness are accurately recorded. However, despite exceeding the required threshold of 120 qualifying payments or ten years of service, my loan balance persists, and the burden of monthly payments continues to weigh heavily on me. As the sole provider for two families, the financial strain of ongoing student loan payments is substantial and increasingly challenging to manage. I firmly believe that my diligent service and consistent payments warrant the completion and payoff of my student loan, in accordance with the PSLF program guidelines.

I

kindly request your immediate attention to rectify this discrepancy and ensure that my payment count accurately reflects my years of service and dedication to public service. It is my sincere hope that by correcting this oversight, I can alleviate the financial burden I currently face and achieve the long-awaited relief of student loan forgiveness. I urge you to expedite the review and correction of my payment count, as every month of continued repayment adds to the financial strain I endure. Your swift action in resolving this matter will not only provide much-needed relief but also restore my faith in the integrity of the PSLF program. Please feel free to contact me at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  or XXXX, if further information or clarification is required to facilitate the resolution process. I sincerely appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a favorable outcome.

Thank you for your understanding and assistance.

In my case : The account, after its transfer, should not reflect any late payments. However, it inaccurately shows that I have late payments recorded.

The reported payment status contradicts the history of late payments, which misleads potential lenders and adversely affects my creditworthiness.

Under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), I have the right to dispute any inaccurate information, and credit bureaus, including Experian, are obligated to investigate and correct or delete any inaccuracies within 30 days.

Despite my efforts to rectify this situation, the inaccuracies remain, causing significant distress and hindering my ability to secure a home loan. I urge the CFPB to investigate this matter and ensure that Experian complies with its obligations under the FCRA. 

I am submitting a formal complaint under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) regarding inaccurate information on my credit report by XXXX, XXXX, and Experian student loan accounts ; that have been consolidated into the XXXX Department of Education. 

Upon reviewing my credit report, I noticed that this account XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is incorrectly marked as 120 days late, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in payments. Despite being transferred and reported as paying as agreed In payment status and at the time of the consolidation. This information is inconsistent and misleading, which negatively impacts my credit standing. 
My report Also reflects multiple student loan payments listed under separate accounts, despite the fact that my loans were consolidated into one loan.

Creditor Name : [ XXXX ] Account Number ( Last Four Digits ) : [ XXXX ] Date of Reported Late Payment : [ XX/XX/XXXX / XX/XX/XXXX ] Reported Status : Transferred/Paid as Agreed Issue : Late payments are inaccurately reported despite consolidation Amount owed I not the amount reported FCRA Violations : According to 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, data furnishers are required to report accurate and complete information. In this case : 1. The account was transferred/consolidated and should not reflect late payments post-transfer..

2. The payment status contradicts the late payment history, which misleads lenders and affects my creditworthiness.

3. Under FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681i ), I have the right to dispute any inaccurate or incomplete information, and the credit bureaus must correct or delete inaccurate data within 30 days.

This has resulted in the loss of Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) credit, as confirmed by an Aidvantage representative in writing. 
XX/XX/year> : I submitted an IDR application, selecting the lowest available repayment plan to maintain PSLF eligibility. 
XX/XX/year> : Aidvantage sent a letter stating my request was not processed and placed my loans into forbearance. 
XX/XX/year> : I contacted Aidvantage via chat and was informed : My PSLF credit is not accruing due to this error. 
I must reapply instead of Aidvantage fixing the mistake internally, delaying PSLF further.

PSLF credit will not be backdated once the issue is resolved. 
XX/XX/year> : I filed a complaint with the Federal Student Aid Ombudsman ( Case # XXXX ), but Aidvantage has yet to provide a solution.

Issues 1. Aidvantage mishandled my IDR request, placing my loans into forbearance instead of an IDR plan.

2. I am losing PSLF credit monthly, with no resolution or backdating offered.

3. Aidvantage refuses to correct their mistake, forcing me to reapply and restart the process.

Resolution Requested 1. Immediate processing of my original IDR request so PSLF credit resumes accruing. 
2. Backdating of PSLF credit to cover the months lost due to Aidvantages error.

3. Formal written confirmation from the Department of Education ensuring my PSLF eligibility is not negatively impacted.

Under Borrower Defense to Repayment ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( h ) ), I should have been granted forgiveness for these loans when it was established that I was misled into obtaining them. Yet, the loans remain on my credit report, and I have been subjected to continued financial and emotional harm every single day since XXXX XXXX XXXX. Multiple Loan Servicers and Harassment Over the last 20 years, my loans have been transferred between multiple servicers, each of whom has subjected me to constant harassment. Despite the fraudulent nature of these loans, I have received countless phone calls, emails, and letters demanding payment and threatening wage garnishment. This harassment violates the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ), which explicitly forbids abusive and deceptive collection practices. This relentless harassment, combined with the wrongful reporting of my loans, has caused irreparable damage to my credit score, my financial well-being, and my ability to maintain peace of mind. I am legally entitled to compensation for each incident of harassment and wrongful reporting. Continuous Credit Reporting Violations Since XX/XX/XXXX, these fraudulent loans have been reported daily to all three major credit bureausXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXdespite the fact that they were obtained through fraud. This is a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), which mandates accurate and fair reporting of consumer information. The wrongful reporting of these loans has destroyed my credit score, leading to severely high interest rates on my home and car loans, preventing me from accessing credit cards, and barring me from obtaining business financing. Every day that this false information remains on my credit report has caused ongoing and compounding financial damage. Loss of Wages Due to Financial Hardship The damage to my credit has significantly impacted my ability to earn a living. I currently make approximately {$4000.00} per month, but without the financial hardship caused by these fraudulent loans, I would be able to earn an estimated {$11000.00} per month based on my education, skills, and potential employment opportunities. The difference of {$7100.00} per month represents lost wages due to the financial and credit barriers created by these loans. Over the past XXXX days ( from XX/XX/XXXX, to today ), this financial loss has accumulated as follows : Difference in monthly income : {$11000.00} ( expected earnings ) - {$4000.00} ( actual earnings ) = {$7100.00}. Loss per day : {$7100.00} 30 days = approximately {$230.00} per day in lost wages. Total loss of wages : {$230.00} XXXX days = {>= $1,000,000}. Emotional and Physical Damages For more than 20 years, I have lived under extreme eXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX due to the wrongful reporting of these loans and the continuous harassment from loan servicers. The financial instability caused by my damaged credit score has forced me to live in unsafe neighborhoods, endure high-interest loans, and be denied opportunities to grow my business. These circumstances have caused physical and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Under Pennsylvania law and federal consumer protection laws, I am entitled to compensation for these emotional and physical damages. Based on industry standards and precedent cases, emotional and physical distress damages typically range from {$1000.00} to {$5000.00} per day, depending on the severity of the harm caused. Given the ongoing and extreme nature of the distress I have endured, I am claiming {$3500.00} per day in damages for emotional and psychological harm. Damages per day for emotional and physical distress : {$3500.00}. Total days : XXXX days. Total compensation for emotional and physical damages : {$3500.00} XXXX days = {>= $1,000,000}. Punitive Damages In addition to compensatory damages, I am seeking punitive damages to hold the responsible parties accountable for their egregious actions. The fact that I have had to endure over two decades of financial hardship, harassment, and emotional distress due to fraudulent loans demands a punitive response to deter similar misconduct in the future. Punitive damages are awarded in cases of willful and reckless conduct, such as the repeated harassment and violation of consumer protection laws in my case. I am seeking punitive damages equivalent to three times the compensatory damages calculated above, in accordance with legal precedent. Punitive damages : 3 ( {>= $1,000,000} total compensatory damages ) = {>= $1,000,000}. Detailed Calculation of Violations and Damages The following is a comprehensive breakdown of the damages owed, based on legitimate legal statutes, with references to daily violations and accrued losses : Violation Rate per Day/Incident Number of Days/Incidents Total Borrower Defense Violation ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ) $ XXXX XXXX days {>= $1,000,000} FCRA Violation ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) $ XXXX ( XXXX bureaus ) XXXX days {>= $1,000,000} XXXX Harassment ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ) $ XXXX XXXX incidents {>= $1,000,000} XXXXL Violation ( XXXX P.S. XXXX et seq. ) $ XXXX XXXX days {>= $1,000,000} Loss of Wages $ XXXX XXXX days {>= $1,000,000} Emotional and Physical Distress $ XXXX XXXX days {>= $1,000,000} Total Damages to Date {>= $1,000,000} Punitive Damages : {>= $1,000,000}. XXXX XXXX Damages : {>= $1,000,000}. Ongoing Damages The damages outlined above reflect violations and financial harm up to today, XX/XX/XXXX. However, these damages will continue to accrue daily until this matter is fully resolved. The cost of each violation will continue to increase, and the emotional and financial burden on me will persist. Conclusion and Request for Immediate Action As of today, I am owed a total of {>= $1,000,000} in compensatory and punitive damages. This figure continues to increase each day as the violations and harm persist. I demand the immediate removal of these fraudulent loans from my credit report, the cessation of all collection activities, and full financial compensation for the extensive and irreparable damage done to my life over the past 20 years. I expect the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to take swift action to rectify these egregious violations of the law. Please acknowledge receipt of this complaint and provide guidance on the next steps.

As a full-time student, my loans should have remained in deferment per 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( f ). However, my servicer falsely took these loans out of deferment, violating my rights under federal law. The reported amounts, dates, and statuses are also inaccurate and misleading, compounding the harm caused by their improper management. 

Furthermore, I was misled by representatives who provided contradictory information regarding the terms and use of these loans. I was explicitly told that these loans would support my education and related expenses, but their terms prohibit such use. This constitutes a clear case of misrepresentation, violating the Truth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1638 ) and Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices ( UDAAP ) standards. 

The loan terms are also predatory and unconscionable. The excessive interest rates and fees are designed to trap borrowers in perpetual debt. These practices, combined with the servicers failure to comply with federal deferment requirements, have caused me significant financial and emotional hardship. 

I demand the immediate cancellation of these loans and removal of all negative information from my credit report.

Rule : 16 CFR 254.4 - Misrepresentation of facilities, services, qualifications of staff, status, and employment prospects for students after the training. 
( a ) It is deceptive for an Industry Member to misrepresent, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, in advertising, promotional materials, recruitment sessions, or in any other manner, the size, location, services, facilities, curriculum, books and materials, or equipment of its school or the number or educational qualifications of its faculty and other personnel. For example, an Industry Member should not : ( 3 ) Misrepresent the availability of employment or the role of the school in providing or arranging for said employment while the student is undergoing instruction.

( 8 ) Misrepresent the nature and extent of any personal instruction, guidance, assistance, or other service, including placement assistance and assistance overcoming language barriers or XXXX  XXXX, it will provide students either during or after completion of a course ( XXXX ) It is deceptive for an Industry Member, in promoting any course or program of instruction in its advertising, promotional materials, or in any other manner, to misrepresent, directly or indirectly, expressly or by implication, whether through the use of text, images, endorsements, or by other means, the availability of employment after graduation from a school or program of instruction, the specific type of employment available to a student after graduation from a school or program of instruction, the success that the Industry Member 's graduates have realized in obtaining such employment, including the percentage of graduates who have received employment, or the salary or salary range that the Industry Member 's graduates have received, or can be expected to receive, in such employment. 
Analysis : Before XXXX enrollment in XXXX XXXX, she was a wife, mother, and successful businesswoman looking to elevate her career to the next level to further provide for her family. She frequently heard the radio, saw television, billboards, etc. advertisements about XXXX XXXX success rate in job placement and opportunities after attending and graduating with a degree from XXXX. It was because of these claims that were abundantly advertised, that XXXX decided on XXXX XXXX  to further her education. In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX enrolled in the XXXX XXXX XXXX : in Accounting and Business Management. 
Since her graduation from the program in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX has not been able to be gainfully employed nor has she received any assistance or job leads in her field of study. 
According to an article that was published by the Department of Education on XX/XX/XXXX, After a review of voluminous amounts of evidence, the Department found that from XXXX to XXXX DeVry repeatedly misled prospective students across the country with claims that XXXX percent of XXXX graduates who actively seek employment obtained jobs in their field of study within XXXX months of graduation. This claim was the foundation of a national advertising campaign called, We Major in Careers to brand DeVry as a XXXX XXXX University where it used the XXXX percent placement statistic as the way to convince prospective students to enroll. 
In fact, the institutions actual job placement rate was around XXXX percent. The Department found that more than half of the jobs included in the claimed XXXX percent placement rate were held by students who obtained them well before graduating from XXXX and often before they even enrolled. These jobs were not attributable to a XXXX education and their inclusion was contrary to the plain language of the XXXX percent claim. Moreover, XXXX excluded from its calculation large numbers of graduates who were in fact actively looking for work simply because they did not conduct a search in the manner that the XXXX XXXX XXXX department preferred. 
The Department also found that senior XXXX officials knew of the problems with the XXXX percent statistic for years, in part due to concerns about its accuracy raised by alumni. 
In XXXX, the FTC reached a {$100.00} XXXX settlement with XXXX around similar allegations. The Department also reached a settlement with XXXX related to older job placement rate statistics in XXXX. The attorneys general of New York and Massachusetts also reached agreements with XXXX in XXXX to resolve allegations of misleading job placement rates. 
During this period of misrepresentation, XXXX was a publicly traded company owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which was later renamed XXXX XXXX XXXX. Senior leaders at XXXX during this time included XXXX XXXX, who served as President and CEO from XXXX through XXXX and XXXX XXXX, who served as the XXXX vice president and/or president of XXXX University XXXX XXXX through XXXX. XXXX sold XXXX in XXXX. 
Conclusion : In conclusion, to date, the Department has identified approximately XXXX borrowers who will be eligible for approximately {$71.00} XXXX in discharges because they relied on XXXX misrepresentation in deciding to enroll. The number of approvals is anticipated to grow as the Department reviews outstanding claims from former XXXX students. All borrowers with approved claims will receive full relief.

I have received an email on XX/XX/XXXX directly from federal student aid that explicitly authorizes SAVE borrowers, like myself, presently on a general forbearance ( which I never requested and was place in without my consent ), to apply for any other income driven repayment plan. I in fact applied for the XXXX plan on XX/XX/XXXX, which Mohela received on XX/XX/XXXX. To date they have not processed my application. Today, my call was eventually escalated to an agent with Mohela 's resolution department. Her name is XXXX and her employee ID number is XXXX. She informed me that Mohela has been instructed by the department of education to NOT PROCESS XXXX APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE PRESENTLY ON SAVE. She later acknowledge this was incorrect information and she was mistaken but that its hard to keep up with federal changes. It is Mohelas obligation to be up to date on federal updates. She further informed me the department of education instructed Mohela to NOT PLACE BORROWERS PRESENTLY STUCK ON SAVE WHO REQUEST A DIFFERENT XXXX PLAN IN A PROCESSING FORBEARANCE THAT COUNTS TOWARDS public service loan forgiveness. She was adamant about this. That position is in direct contradiction to an email I received from federal student aid on XX/XX/XXXX, which I can provide you. It is also in direct contradiction to information on XXXX 's website, which does not indicate ANYWHERE that SAVE BORROWERS are not entitled to the processing forbearance and are not entitled to have their XXXX applications reviewed or acted upon -- both of which XXXX told me today.

This breach constitutes a direct violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and Title IV regulations, as well as an egregious violation of my personal privacy and financial security. 

I recently discovered that my sensitive and legally protected records were accessed and potentially shared without my consent. This includes but is not limited to : XXXX. My academic records and personally identifiable information ( PII ). 
XXXX. My Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) data, including financial aid history and loan information. 
XXXX. My IRS tax transcripts, which were obtained and used without proper authorization. 

These actions violate my rights under FERPA ( 20 U.S.C. 1232g ; 34 CFR Part 99 ), which grants me the right to control access to my educational records, as well as Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which governs the use and protection of federal student aid information. Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. 

Given the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : XXXX. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. 
XXXX. A formal investigation into this data breach, including details on how my records were accessed, who accessed them, and for what purpose. 
XXXX. A full report on the extent of my data exposure and the corrective measures being implemented to prevent future violations. 
XXXX. Immediate notification to all major credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) to place a fraud alert and investigate any unauthorized activity that may have resulted from this breach. 

This breach has caused significant distress and concern regarding the security of my personal and financial data. If my demands are not met within 30 days, I will be left with no choice but to escalate this matter through legal channels, including filing complaints with the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), and pursuing legal action against the responsible parties. 

I request a written response addressing these concerns and outlining the immediate actions being taken to remedy this situation. Please direct all correspondence to the address listed above. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent matter. I look forward to your immediate response and resolution.

Around XX/XX/XXXX I checked Student Aid 's website to see that my payment counts had been updated and suddenly, I was now at XXXX. Excitedly, I submitted a request to change my repayment plan, hoping to switch from the SAVE plan to a regular IDR plan so I could get my final payment to count and trigger my forgiveness finally. There was no confirmation about this. I contacted my servicer, XXXX, and StudentAid.gov, who confirmed the application is in, but currently in processing limbo.

XX/XX/XXXX - MOHELA sends me XXXX  stating XXXX has directed MOHELA to put my account into the 0 % interest forbearance ( reminder : this should have been done by MOHELA on XX/XX/XXXX ). Even though I receive this message, interest continues to build on my loan daily through MOHELA and my loan summary through the MOHELA portal does not change to indicate I am in any form on 0 % interest forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX - MOHELA sends me XXXX  reminding me {$1900.00} payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Interest is still accruing. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I call MOHELA to attempt to clarify why I received a message stating I would be in the properly triggered 0 % interest forbearance ( albeit 2 months late ) and then subsequently I receive a message stating my payment is still due on XX/XX/XXXX and interest is still accruing on my loans. No clarification is given and I am ultimately told to wait until it gets sorted out behind-the-scenes. I request a forbearance extension again which is given ( but not the 0 % interest forbearance ) XX/XX/XXXX - I receive a XXXX  from MOHELA titled "" Loan Update '' reminding me interest is building on my loan while in forbearance noting accrued interest to date is {$9500.00}. Note : if I was correctly placed on the 0 % interest forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX my total interest should only be {$4700.00}. Calculation below for reference. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX is 90 days. 6.125 % interest annually on a principal of {$310000.00} is roughly {$53.00} a day. {$53.00} x 90 = {$4700.00}.

Ultimately, I am told to wait and there is nothing they can do. 

XX/XX/XXXX - MOHELA sends me XXXX stating Federal Student Aid has directed MOHELA to put my account into the 0 % interest forbearance ( reminder : this should have occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and is now the 2nd time I have received this notification ). Even though I receive this message, interest continues to build on my loan daily through MOHELA and my loan summary through the MOHELA portal does not change to indicate I am in any form on 0 % interest forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX - I call again to try to clarify why I was told ( for the 2nd time now ) my account was directed to be placed on 0 % interest by the Department of Education to MOHELA, but interest continues to build.

Specifically, XXXX XXXX  misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

02/14/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I have been trying to change my loan repayment plan from the standard plan to the graduated plan with Mohela for the past three to four months. I initially tried to change it with them XX/XX/XXXX, but they said it would take time to process the change. 
I called back in XXXX asking for an update, because I hadn't received any correspondence from them regarding the issue. They claimed that it would take longer to process ( up to 45 business days ), so they put in a request for the account to have a forbearance until the process was complete ( this should process in 7 business days ). 
I again hadn't received any correspondence about the approval or denial of forbearance, and I had to access my Mohela account to determine that it was approved ( until XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I still haven't received confirmation about the loan repayment plan change, and the account doesn't show a change. It just shows payment due XX/XX/XXXX on the standard payment plan. I called again today, and after waiting for five hours for a call-back, they claimed they couldn't do anything for me in that department and I had to be transferred. I understand there are different departments in call centers and customer service, however, after transferring, it said there was an additional five hour wait time ( without a call-back ) and then the call dropped after an hour of waiting.

Throughout these four months, there has been no correspondence from Mohela about any status updates or approvals/denials, and I have needed to call several times on different occasions to be able to speak to someone about these issues. It takes several calls and/or several hours [ of waiting ] to be able to speak to someone, and the account doesn't show any correspondence that I have sent to them in the respective section nor any evidence they've tried to send me correspondence.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,UT,84128,None,Consent provided,Web,02/14/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,12079573
01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"MOHELA has intentionally delayed processing of my Income Based Repayment plan, Pay A You Earn plan, application since XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX. My account was placed in special forbearance for 60 days in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX to allow MOHELA to process my XXXX application, which they neglected to do. On XXXX XXXX I received notice from MOHELA informing me of a due payment by XXXX XXXX. Then, on XXXX XXXX I received notice from MOHELA stating my account was placed in forbearance and no further action was needed. Then, on XXXX XXXX I was notified by MOHELA that I missed my payment that was due on XXXX XXXX. I then filed a complaint to MOHELA describing the above sequence of events, and requesting they rectify the issue by removing the delinquent payment from my account, and to change my account to reflect the forbearance status until they process my XXXX application. I received a reply from MOHELA on XXXX XXXX that appeared to imply my complaint was an application for forbearance, stating that once my application for forbearance was processed the delinquent payment ( XXXX ) would be resolved, seeming to ignore entirely that my account was/should already be in forbearance status. The letter went on to report a completely different amount owed, {$400.00}. compared to the {$1400.00} reported on the website and in previous letters, seeming to imply an XXXX payment plan as opposed to the Standard Plan. 

I attempted a second time to rectify this issue with Mohela via a phone call on XXXX XXXX in which after explaining the above to the representative, I was transferred to an "" advanced '' representative where I was placed on hold for almost XXXX hours before opting for the call-back feature. I have yet to have been called back by MOHELA. 

I submitted a second complaint today requesting the XXXX and now XXXX missed payments be removed from my account, that my account be placed into forbearance, and that MOHELA process my XXXX application as soon as possible. 

It appears that MOHELA has already processed my XXXX plan application evidenced by the {$400.00} amount due noted in the XXXX XXXX reply to my complaint, yet continues to send bills for {$1400.00} under the XXXX XXXX plan. 

MOHELA has negligently handled the processing of XXXX applications, mishandled the processing of forbearance, all while hiding behind a federal injunction on the XXXX XXXX  in an attempt to maximize their profit at the expense of myself and other borrowers. This has the potential to significantly impact my credit rating should my account be placed in Default. This also has impacted my ability to make qualifying payments for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as I have not been able to make qualifying payments since XX/XX/year>.

01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"Per Mohela, I recertified my income for XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. A month later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept. Of Ed announced that they were extending to deadline to XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and if a recertification submitted early and payments were increased, the servicer would revert payments to the previous monthly amount until the new deadline ( We will return you to your previous monthly payment amount until your new recertification deadline ). 

After recertification, I was informed on XX/XX/XXXX that my student loan payments would be {$160.00} ; the previous months amount ( billed on XXXX XXXX ) was {$0.00}. 

Once the announcement was released, I contacted Mohela by phone to inquire when my payments would revert to the previous monthly amount. I was informed that they were working on it and to call back in a month. I called again, and was informed to keep calling monthly to ensure the payments would return to {$0.00} - each representative put my repayment on an administrative forbearance until the issue was resolved. I had to call monthly for this forbearance as the issue wasnt being corrected. I was also informed that if payments were not corrected, I didnt have to pay and that they were still working on correcting the issue. Unfortunately most of my correspondence with Mohela had been over the phone. I have requested a written record of each conversation, but was denied. However, I have been told that my conversations have been recorded and are in my record. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondance from Mohela that my payments would be {$160.00}. This information confirmed the issue that Mohela hasnt done anything to correct my payment amount and align with the Dept. Of Ed. 

I have filed XXXX ( XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) different complaints with Mohela. My cases have been closed, though all of the responses from Mohela do not address the issue or acknowledge that they are working on fixing the problem. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received correspondance from Mohela that, MOHELA at the direction of the Department of Education, has changed the date by which you need to recertify your current XXXX plan to XX/XX/XXXX. This means that the payment amount should be the amount I was billed in XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,OR,972XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11366646

Despite providing all three credit bureaus with documentation that my loans were forgiven, this information has not been accurately reflected on my credit reports, negatively impacting my credit score. 

I have contacted the credit bureaus directly, submitted a dispute with supporting documentation, and allowed the legally required 30-day period for an investigation and correction under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). However, my reports still show the incorrect loan status, which is not only inaccurate but also a violation of my consumer rights under the FCRA. 

The inaccurate reporting is causing significant harm to my financial well-being, including but not limited to : Lowering my credit score. 
Hindering my access to fair credit opportunities. 
Causing undue stress and financial instability. 

I am requesting the CFPB to intervene and assist in ensuring that my credit reports are promptly updated to reflect the correct informationspecifically, that the forgiven loans show a {$0.00} balance or are removed as appropriate. I am also seeking confirmation of the corrective actions taken by the credit bureaus and the creditors involved.

Following Mohelas XXXX timeline to update credit bureaus, I checked my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX, but found no update. Instead, I noticed an increase to {$1400.00} on my XXXX report. Despite disputing the charge and several follow-up calls to Mohela, XXXX was repeatedly informed that my payment was still in processing, although they had confirmed receipt. 
Key Developments and Issues : XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Mohelas representative, XXXX ( ID XXXX ), confirmed the payment was mistakenly applied to Loan # XXXX instead of Loan # XXXX. She cited system migration issues and assured me a correction would be submitted, with an expected XXXX turnaround. Yet, in XXXX, the issue remained unresolved. 
XXXX. I escalated the matter to Mohelas supervisor, XXXX ( ID XXXX ), on XX/XX/XXXX, who sent escalation tickets to both the accounting and account rebuild ( conversion ) teams. Although this seemed promising, my credit report remains inaccurate, and Mohela has yet to report my payment to all three credit bureaus. 
XXXX. During my latest follow-up on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX ( ID XXXX ) confirmed that the audit was completed on XX/XX/XXXX, and a XXXX ticket ( Case # XXXX ) is still pending. Despite these internal steps, the issue remains unreported to the credit bureaus, continuing to impact my credit score.

I am asking that you take immediate action to ensure relief for myself and hundreds of thousands of defrauded borrowers. Please do not leave me and hundreds of thousands of defrauded students in the lurch, with our financial freedom and ability to live a full life hanging in the balance. A majority of us went to schools that have a history of misconduct well known to the Department of Education. We know that the Department of Education has findings for many of these schools, and that there is a preponderance of evidence to justify approval of the majority of outstanding Borrower Defense applications. I am asking you to act now, before it is too late. I am sure you know quite well that Borrower Defense and the Department of Education itself are at risk. All students who are suffering under the extreme weight of this fraudulent debt should have their Borrower Defenses approved immediately so we can finally be free to work toward our American Dream, a dream that has been stolen from us by often notoriously predatory companies. 
When I was a XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX attending XXXX XXXX University, I applied to multiple veterinary schools. I immediately received an acceptance to XXXX University along with a few other schools both international and in the states later on. However, XXXX changed my acceptance date to XXXX instead of XXXX and stated that I must attend or lose my seat. At that time I was upset because I did not apply for that class and had well above the accepted GPA and requirements to attend XXXX. I was forced to attend prior to hearing from other schools which now that I know more students stories, I was not the only one. XXXX has done this with countless students they fear of losing, if they allow us to hear back from other schools. Next was the education once arriving. XXXX promotes being a hands on school and allowing students to graduate practice ready. However, when COVID happened they did the opposite. At that time they made bugs get cuts for labs and staffing while increasing our cost of education and removing necessary laboratories and practicals despite government approval to allow them. This has directly impacted me as a practitioner, my patients, and my financial health. As a result of their lack of education I was not practice ready and needed to take extra courses, do extra training, and make less income as a result. This is not just the case for me but for many others. I understand the hardship of Covid but XXXX elected to neglect students, raise tuition, and the results have been clear and statistically proven on the XXXX. The XXXX is the board exam for veterinary practitioners and XXXX pass rate has dropped significantly below average and potentially losing XXXX accreditation. To help stop this XXXX has encouraged students from not taking the XXXX immediately because they fear their pass right will be low. The pass rate they advertise is for students taking the exam twice while the majority of schools post a first time pass rate. Overall XXXX has clearly taken a step back in their quality of education to have better profit margins and it has impacted the lives of thousands of students. As I result I am now in almost half a XXXX XX/XX/XXXXin debt, unable to get a mortgage, and struggling financially despite what is considered a good salary compared to the general public. This can very well be contributed to XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXXteam that encouraged a large student loan be taken out each semester rather than taking a minimal loan.

Given the gravity of this breach, I am requesting the immediate voiding of all student loan payments for affected borrowers, including myself, as the Department of Education has failed to uphold its duty to protect our sensitive financial data. The unauthorized access by DOGE personnel has compromised the legitimacy of loan servicing and borrower agreements, warranting full loan cancellation as an appropriate remedy.

2. Confirmation that my personal data has not been misused or further shared.

3. Immediate implementation of stronger security measures to prevent future unauthorized access.

4. A formal response detailing the Departments corrective actions and any borrower remedies.

Specifically, I have recently discovered that my personal and financial information was compromised without my authorization when shared with XXXX XXXX and his employees, which is a direct violation of FERPAs protections regarding the privacy of student and parent records. 
FERPA requires that educational institutions and loan servicers such as Mohela safeguard and protect the privacy of student and parent records. By disclosing my personal information to individuals and entities not authorized under FERPA, you have breached the legal requirements set forth under this act.

As a result of the severity of this breach and the compromise of my personal and financial information, I have lost trust in your ability to protect my private information and therefore request that my loans be immediately canceled and discharged.

Please consider this letter an official notification that I am discontinuing my loan payments until I receive satisfactory answers regarding the FERPA violation. If I do not hear back from you within 5 days, I will be forced to take further legal actions to protect my rights.

01/15/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Mohela has seriously and repeatedly mismanaged my student loans in multiple ways. 

In XXXX, Mohela placed me into multiple forbearances and provided me with incorrect and conflicting information regarding each. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced into a forbearance due to Mohelas website platform transition - but was repeatedly assured that any months spent in this forbearance WOULD be eligible months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was again forced into a forbearance by Mohela- this time with the stated justification of seeing if I was eligible for new benefits. Again I was assured that any months spent in this forbearance WOULD be eligible months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). 

Despite the facts outlined above, and also in spite of the fact that I have an approved employment certification form on record for the entire period of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, Mohela has deemed both my months of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as ineligible for PSLF. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was forced into a forbearance due to SAVE litigation - but I was assured that I could 1 ) switch from SAVE to another payment plan and 2 ) apply for buyback of any months spent in this forbearance. 

Subsequent to the events above, in XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, I : 1. Applied for reconsideration of XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX based on the previous assurances I received from Mohela, along with those months not being part of SAVE litigation. I have received no response to these requests, and when I have repeatedly asked for information on request status, I am told they are under review with no estimated time for the review provided. 
2. Applied for buyback of XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX. 
I have followed up on each of those multiple times since then, only to be told that they have been escalated and are under review with no estimated time for the review provided. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to switch from the SAVE repayment plan into the IBR repayment plan. According to official guidance from both the Federal Student Loan program and Mohela, upon receipt of any IDR Application, a student loan account will be placed in a Processing Forbearance for 60 days, during which interest accrues and is eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) and IDR forgiveness. However, despite this official guidance and also repeated requests from me, Mohela has refused to place my student loans into a Processing Forbearance, and instead is leaving them in the SAVE Forbearance, which does not count towards PSLF or IDR forgiveness. 

The result of the above outlined actions is that, although according to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Mohelas own system, I have 187 qualifying payments for PSLF and 154 of those payment months also have accepted employment certification forms, Mohela has only deemed 118 of my payment months as eligible for PSLF ( the latest being XX/XX/XXXX ). 

Via the following actions : 1 ) Refusing to honor their assurances that XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX would count towards PSLF, and 2 ) Refusing to place my account into a PSLF-qualifying Processing Forbearance for 60 days as required by Federal Student Loan guidance, Mohela is effectively holding my account hostage at 118 payments ( two payments below the number required for PSLF ) and refusing to forgive my loans through PSLF despite my having earned it.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,MOHELA,LA,70122,None,Consent provided,Web,01/15/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11545374

Despite my application for loan consolidation under the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) program, my loans were not properly consolidated, and I was erroneously placed into default. Additionally, my repayment period was initiated a year earlier than it should have been, further contributing to an incorrect balance.

Key Issues Requiring Investigation and Resolution : 1. Erroneous Default Status I applied for loan consolidation under XXXX in XX/XX/year>, which, according to federal guidelines, should have removed my loans from default and placed them into an eligible repayment plan. 

Despite my compliance with program requirements, my loan was not consolidated, and I was improperly reported as being in default, negatively impacting my credit and financial standing. 

This administrative failure warrants an immediate correction, with my loan being removed from default and consolidated as originally intended. 

XXXX. Incorrect Loan Balance Due to Premature Repayment Start My repayment period was supposed to begin after exiting my graduate program ; however, the servicer initiated repayment a year earlier. 

This premature repayment initiation led to an artificially inflated balance and unwarranted delinquency. 

As this action was a clear administrative error, I am requesting a full recalculation of the correct balance, with any improperly assessed interest and penalties removed.

If you are unable to provide the requested documentation within **30 days** of this notice, I demand that you **immediately cease reporting this account** to credit bureaus and remove all negative entries related to this matter. Any failure to comply with this request will result in my pursuit of legal action to enforce my rights under the law, including potential complaints to the **Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) ** and other regulatory agencies.

01/30/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"This complaint is regarding my student loan servicer 's ( Nelnet 's ) unfair and deceptive interest accrual practices. My loan servicer is continuing to charge interest on a loan even after I have paid it in full, applying interest to the previous balance until the next billing cycle. This practice is misleading and financially harmful to borrowers who, like me, are hard workers, struggling to pay off their loans while providing for themselves and family. When I pay off a loan, I expect that my payment immediately stops all interest accrual on that balance. However, an advisor told me that interest continues accumulating based on my old balance until the next billing cycle begins, even though the loan has already been paid off. I seem to be getting new information every time I call the servicer, too! I believe this is an unfair financial practice because : Borrowers are misled into thinking they have fully paid their loans when they actually owe additional interest. This creates unnecessary additional charges that make it harder for borrowers to pay off debt
efficiently.

Other financial institutions ( like credit card companies ) do not operate this way, so why are student loan servicers allowed to?

I request that the CFPB investigate this practice and enforce clearer, fairer policies regarding interest accrual and loan payoff timelines.

Student loan servicers are gauging VULNERABLE people. I, for one, am very well-read and intelligent -- yet there is alway something new and different I learn about the loopholes that student loan servicers exploit. Again, if I were to loan individuals money and pull this criminal activity, I would be sued. These companies need to have spines and operate fairly.

01/13/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"I have been working toward loan discharge for XXXX. In XX/XX/year>, I completed my XXXX payment. In XX/XX/year>, I sent in my employee certification form using the manual upload from the PSLF help tool. 

After receiving no response, in XXXX, I contacted customer service on studentaid.gov. The agent suggested I wait until "" the end of fall '' to submit again. I submitted it again using the same manual upload method via PSLF help tool on the studentaid.gov website in XX/XX/year>. 

A few weeks later, I once again contacted customer service. The agent told me that there was no signature on the XXXX XXXX. Knowing that was not true, I thanked the agent, hung up, and called again to speak to a new agent. The new agent said she could see that the form had the appropriate signature but maybe I should try submitting it through USPS. 

In XX/XX/year>, I mailed the XXXX using USPS. I also faxed the form. Still no response. 

On XX/XX/year>, I submitted the form using the electronic signature option through the PSLF help tool. For all of these attempts, I used the same form that I originally filled out in XXXX with all of the correct information, including my employment start date. The form was signed by the HR representative of the organization I work for. 

The studentaid.gov website shows, under "" My Activity '' that the form I submitted in XX/XX/year> is still in review. It also shows that the form I submitted electronically in XXXX has been reviewed and is complete. Under the "" My Activity '' section, there is nothing indicating that the form I sent via USPS or fax has been received. There is also no information for the form I uploaded manually in XX/XX/year> under "" My Activity. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, my payment count for PSLF on the studentaid.gov website was updated to reflect that I have reached 120 payments. However, I also received a rejection letter stating that the employee start date was missing or invalid. I checked on the studentaid.gov website under "" My Dashboard. '' The status tracker states that the form I submitted via manual upload in XXXX was received on both XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/year> and then rejected and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the PSLF Form Information on the website for that same submission has the employee start date plainly stated and when I downloaded the XXXX form that was rejected, it also had the employee start date plainly stated. 

I called customer service twice to ask what steps I needed to take next. Both customer service agents acknowledged that they could see that the employment start date was there but since the form had already been rejected, I needed to send the form yet again. Both suggested that I submit it with the electronic signature, even though the form I sent in XXXX via electronic signature has already been reviewed and the website says is complete. 

In the past week, I have attempted to go through the PSLF help tool, which is the only way to submit the form either electronically or via manual upload, and that page of the PSLF website will not load. I have been trying for a few days. The help tool page will not load.

At this point, I have no idea what to do. My payment count has been updated saying no more payments on my loan are required. Every form that I have sent has the employee start date written plainly on the form, and the studentaid.gov website itself shows the correct employee start date that the rejection letter says is somehow missing or incomplete. 

Because the help tool will not load on the website, I have no way to even try to resubmit again, unless it is once again via USPS or fax. But since the website does not even acknowledge receiving the form that I sent via USPS and fax, I have no reason to believe that sending it again through these methods will result in any forward movement with this process. 

I fulfilled my contractual obligations for PSLF and have submitted and resubmitted my employee certification form in every way that is possible.

The school improperly charged me for courses and services that were not adequately provided, resulting in financial aid disbursements that did not align with my actual tuition and educational needs. They mismanaged my financial aid, and I believe they intentionally withheld or misallocated funds, ultimately forcing me to transfer institutions to continue my education. 

I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with XXXX XXXX, but my efforts have been ignored or dismissed. I am seeking the CFPBs assistance in investigating this matter, ensuring that XXXX is held accountable for their deceptive practices, and recovering the funds that were wrongly taken from me. 

Please let me know if you require any additional information to proceed with this dispute. I appreciate your time and assistance in this urgent matter.

This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Summary and Statements of Facts. 
We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts.

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

For example, the loan for {$1700.00} isn't even a loan with the US dept of education. I've never received disclosures or notice about this loan being transferred or handled by the US dept of Ed or Nelnet. I wasn't even informed that Nelnet was the new servicer of the {$46000.00} loan until I tried settling the loan with a negotiable instrument, then a few days later I've received an email that US dept of Ed wasn't my loan servicer anymore, and Nelnet will be put in its place. 

The loan for {$1700.00} was opened in XXXX, of XXXX. 16 years ago, it was my knowledge that reporting of a student loan after 10 years fell off your report, I was told this by XXXX. So why is a loan from XXXX, that was never handled by the US Dept of Ed still reporting and showing incorrect information to make it seem accurate? They applied false information to my report to make it seem as if it was initially with the Dept of Ed the entire time. So either there is a huge error or a lie.

Specifically, XXXX XXXX  misrepresented job placement rates to prospective students between XXXX  and XXXX, falsely claiming that 90 % of graduates secured jobs in their field of study within six months of graduation. This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 

At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in 26 states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts. 

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 

Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the XXXX XXXX, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it. 

We implore you to act decisively to ensure justice for all borrowers who were misled and exploited. The stakes are simply too high to risk further delays.

In XXXX XXXX upon reviewing my credit report, I discovered that Trellis Company had charged off my student loans without prior notice or correspondence. At no point was I made aware that Trellis had acquired my loans from Navient Student Loans. To my knowledge, the loan was in forbearance and qualified for an income-driven repayment plan. Despite XXXX failure to provide accurate information regarding my loan status, Trellis proceeded to execute a charge-off, denying me the opportunity to address or rectify the matter. 

Upon contacting Trellis to dispute this charge-off and seek clarification, I encountered representatives who were uncooperative, dismissive, and combative. My repeated requests for documentation, as well as transparency regarding the loan transfer and servicing, were denied. This conduct constitutes a failure of fiduciary duty and has resulted in significant and unjustified damage to my credit profile, causing material financial harm and limiting my access to credit. 

In light of the {$1.00} XXXX multi-state settlement and the {$120.00} XXXX settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), I hereby demand the following actions to remedy the harm caused : Immediate Review and Cancellation of the Charged-Off Loan Pursuant to the terms of the settlement, I request that the charged-off loan in question be thoroughly reviewed for eligibility under the settlements loan cancellation provisions. Any associated derogatory marks must be expunged from my credit report. 

Restitution for Credit Damage and Financial Harm I seek restitution for the adverse financial consequences resulting from the mismanagement and improper charge-off of my loan. This includes compensation for any reduction in creditworthiness, increased borrowing costs, or denial of credit.

Full Disclosure and Documentation I demand full transparency regarding the acquisition, servicing, and charge-off of my loan, including : Documentation verifying the transfer of the loan from Navient to Trellis ; A comprehensive loan payment history, including forbearance and repayment options extended to me ; The amortization schedule and all communications pertaining to the loans status.

Correction of Credit Reporting Errors I request that Trellis promptly communicate with all relevant credit reporting agencies to remove or amend any negative reporting associated with this charge-off.

Failure to address and resolve this matter within 30 days from receipt of this letter will compel me to escalate the issue by filing a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and relevant state and federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, I will explore legal avenues for recovery of damages sustained as a result of Trelliss conduct.

This letter serves as official notice of the harm caused and your obligation to take corrective action in compliance with the terms of the recent settlements and prevailing consumer protection laws. I trust that Trellis will act in good faith to remedy this matter expeditiously.

Please confirm receipt of this letter and provide a written response outlining the steps Trellis intends to take to address my concerns.

01/07/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"Subject : Dispute of Unauthorized Loan Consolidation and Request for Proof of Contract Dear Nelnet, I am writing to formally dispute the consolidation of my student loans and to request immediate verification and documentation regarding the loan servicing agreement and any contracts associated with the consolidation.

To clarify, I never requested or authorized the consolidation of my student loans, nor did I consent to any such action. Upon reviewing my loan account, I noticed the consolidation was made without my approval or knowledge, and I did not sign any documents that would legally bind me to such an agreement.

Specifically, I request the following : 1. Proof of Contract : Provide a copy of the signed agreement or authorization form that I allegedly agreed to in relation to the loan consolidation.

2. Loan Consolidation Documentation : Supply any documents detailing the terms and conditions of the loan consolidation, including any notices, agreements, or authorizations indicating that I consented to the consolidation.

3. Verification of Loan Consolidation : Provide clear evidence and records showing when and how the consolidation was executed, including the date of the action and any notices sent to me regarding the change in loan status.

4. Account History and Balance : Provide a complete breakdown of my loan balance, showing how the original loans were consolidated and how the new balance was calculated. Please ensure that all transactions, interest, and fees are accurately reflected.

Given that I did not authorize this consolidation and have not received proof of my agreement to it, I believe the current status of my loan is incorrect and should be investigated and corrected.

Relevant Laws and Violations This dispute is based on violations of the following laws, which ensure that loans are serviced and handled correctly, and that consumers are protected from unauthorized actions : 1. The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ) : Under the FCRA, creditors and servicers are required to report accurate information to credit bureaus. If there are inaccuracies on your credit report resulting from u
nauthorized loan consolidation, you have the right to dispute these errors. The FCRA also mandates that servicers investigate disputes and provide the requested documentation in a timely manner ( usually within 30 days ).

2. The Higher Education Act ( HEA ) ( 20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq. ) : The HEA outlines the rules for federal student loan servicing and consolidation. Loan consolidation must be authorized by the borrower, and servicers are required to provide proper disclosures and documentation regarding any changes to loan status. Unauthorized consolidation is a violation of the borrowers rights under this act.

3. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 et seq. ) : The FDCPA protects consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices by debt collectors. If the loan consolidation is being handled by a debt collection agency or servicer acting as a third party, they are required to adhere to certain standards when communicating and collecting debts. Unauthorized consolidation or failure to provide proper documentation could be a violation of this law.

4. The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : TILA requires lenders to clearly disclose the terms and conditions of loans, including any consolidation agreements. If your loan was consolidated without your consent, the servicer may have violated TILA by failing to provide the required disclosures before proceeding with the consolidation.

5. Regulation Z ( 12 CFR Part 1026 ) : Under Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), lenders and servicers must clearly disclose all loan terms, including those related to consolidation. If these disclosures were not provided, it may constitute a violation of this regulation.

6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) : If you are unable to resolve this matter directly with your servicer, you may file a complaint with the CFPB, which enforces consumer protections related to debt collection, loan servicing, and other financial matters.

Given that I did not authorize this consolidation and have not received proof of my agreement to it, I believe the current status of my loan is incorrect and should be investigated and corrected.

Please treat this request as a formal dispute under the FCRA, HEA, FDCPA, and TILA, which require that loan servicers maintain accurate records and provide proper documentation of loan servicing actions. I expect to receive all requested documentation within 30 days from the date of this letter, in compliance with applicable laws.

If you are unable to provide the requested proof, I ask that you reverse the consolidation and restore the original terms of the loans immediately. Should I not receive a satisfactory response, I will consider escalating this matter through regulatory channels, such as the CFPB and the Department of Education. 

Please respond to this dispute at your earliest convenience and provide the necessary documentation. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

01/20/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I must address an important matter regarding Navients servicing practices related to my account. Throughout my experience, I relied on Navients communications to stay informed about my loan status. At no point did I fail to meet my responsibilities as a borrower to remain in good standing and pursue options for loan management and forgiveness. Despite my efforts, which included regularly contacting Navient and submitting necessary applications, I received repeated denials for student loan forgiveness. Unfortunately, I was not informed that my loan had entered default status ; instead, Navients correspondence consistently indicated that my account was in deferment or forbearance, never notifying me that my loans were actually in default. 

Had Navient provided clear information that my loans were in default, I would have immediately pursued an appropriate program to rehabilitate my loans. Instead, Navient continued to advise that my loans were ineligible for forgiveness without disclosing the reason was due to the default status. This lack of transparency left me under the impression that my loans were in forbearance and misled me away from the necessary steps to resolve my account status and regain eligibility. 

Given these circumstances, I am requesting a thorough review of my account history and a resolution that addresses these miscommunications and omissions. I am hopeful that the CFPB can provide guidance or assistance in ensuring that because of these injustices, my loans are considered paid off. Due to the lawsuit against Navient for my relief, I am asking for all of my loans to be paid off. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please feel free to reach out if any additional information is needed from my end.

Keep in mind my student aid account does show all five employers listed and approved since XXXX of XXXX, but the only counts included to date for loan forgiveness stop at XX/XX/XXXX, so nothing prior between XXXX ( which has never changed ). Jump to today, XX/XX/XXXX. My first phone call to StudentAid, I was told any of my payments prior to XX/XX/XXXX would not be counted (!!!! ) I was in shock. When I asked how, she had limited information to provide and suggested I speak to a supervisor, so I waited and waited. Then told to leave a call back number and a supervisor would return my call. I insisted on same day call back ( it is now XXXX PST and still no call back ). I suspected this, so I called studentaid again and asked specifically WHY the TEPSLF applications were approved but not considered in my counts and this time ( rudely, I may add ) I was told something different : 'because the TEPSLF deadline has already passed '. I was confused so shared with her that I have copies of the same forms I sent to studentaid all date back to XX/XX/XXXX, way before the XX/XX/XXXX deadline on the form, so again requested to speak with a supervisor or file a complaint. I asked for information for both suggestions. Again, no supervisor was available to ask to be put on the wait list a second time with notice to call back the same day ( NADA! ). So, I filed a second complaint with the same issue with student aid today ( XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  ) with a 15-page PDF copy of all correspondence and copies of the TEPSLF forms originally submitted.

Thank you. See below for link and material. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX  "" Department of Education Announces Actions to Fix Longstanding Failures in the Student Loan Programs XX/XX/XXXX Today, the Department of Education announced steps that will bring borrowers closer to public service loan and income-driven repayment ( IDR ) forgiveness by addressing historical failures in the administration of the federal student loan programs. Federal Student Aid ( FSA ) estimates that these changes will result in immediate debt cancellation for at least 40,000 borrowers under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) Program. Several thousand borrowers with older loans will also receive forgiveness through IDR. More than 3.6 million borrowers will also receive at least three years of additional credit toward IDR forgiveness.

"" Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it's certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they're eligible for, '' said U.S. Secretary of Education XXXX XXXX. "" Today, the Department of Education will begin to remedy years of administrative failures that effectively denied the promise of loan forgiveness to certain borrowers enrolled in IDR plans. These actions once again demonstrate the XXXX XXXX XXXX commitment to delivering meaningful debt relief and ensuring federal student loan programs are administered fairly and effectively. '' These actions are part of the Department 's commitment to address historical failures in the administration of the federal student loan program and support student loan borrowers through the pandemic... .Today 's steps will help restore the promise of IDR plans by ensuring that borrowers have an affordable and effective path out of debt. 

Beyond the immediate corrective actions announced today that will provide relief to borrowers harmed in the past, FSA will take action to ensure that borrowers receive these benefits in the future. Below are the actions being taken today. 

Ending "" Forbearance Steering '' Department regulations require that borrowers who are facing difficulty making their loan payments get clear and accurate information from servicers about their options for staying out of delinquency, including IDR plans, and the financial consequences of choosing short-term options like forbearance. However, FSA reviews suggest that loan servicers placed borrowers into forbearance in violation of Department rules, even when their monthly payment under an IDR plan could have been as low as XXXX dollars. These findings are consistent with concerns raised by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state attorneys general. A borrower advised to choose an IDR plan instead of forbearance can get a reduced payment, stay in good standing, and make progress toward loan forgiveness. A borrower advised to choose forbearance -- particularly long-term consecutive or serial uses of forbearance -- can see their loan balance and monthly payments grow due to interest capitalization and lead to delinquency or default. 

The Department will address forbearance steering by : Conducting a One-Time Account Adjustment to Count Certain Long-Term Forbearances toward IDR and PSLF Forgiveness Borrowers steered or inappropriately placed into long-term forbearances miss out on critical progress toward IDR and PSLF forgiveness ; this can set them back years. The Department 's regulations and servicer contracts have safeguards, including a 12-month limit for any single use of forbearance, and a 36-month cumulative limit on discretionary forbearance. A review of past forbearance use shows that long-term use of forbearance was remarkably widespread. More than 13 % of all Direct Loan borrowers between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX have used forbearance for at least 36 months cumulatively. These changes will be applied automatically to borrowers ' accounts later this year. To mitigate the harms of inappropriate steering into long-term forbearance, FSA will conduct a one-time account adjustment that will count forbearances of more than 12 months consecutive and more than 36 months cumulative toward forgiveness under IDR and PSLF. Borrowers who were steered into shorter-term forbearances will be able to seek account review by filing a complaint with the FSA Ombudsman at StudentAid.gov/feedback. 

Increasing Oversight of Servicers ' Forbearance Use FSA will target forbearance steering by restricting servicers ' ability to enroll borrowers in forbearance by text or email, conducting an external review of patterns of forbearance use and servicers ' practices to identify other potential changes to address steering, and working in partnership with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to do regular audits of forbearance use. This will build upon other FSA efforts to improve oversight of loan servicing activities, including stronger accountability provisions in servicing contracts, renewing partnerships with federal and state regulators and clarifying its position on federal preemption of state oversight of loan servicing. 

FSA will begin implementing these changes immediately, but borrowers may not see the effect in their accounts until the last quarter of XXXX. 

Tracking Progress Toward IDR Forgiveness IDR plans offer substantially lower monthly payments for most borrowers. Borrowers on most plans are entitled to forgiveness after 20 years of payments and depend on FSA and its servicers to accurately track their progress toward relief. However, the Department 's review of IDR payment-tracking procedures has revealed significant flaws that suggest borrowers are missing out on progress toward IDR forgiveness.

The Department is committed to fixing this problem swiftly and permanently. XXXX XXXX has directed FSA to : Conduct a One-Time Revision of IDR Payments to Address Past Inaccuracies To fully address past issues with IDR payment counting, FSA will do a one-time revision of IDR-qualifying payments for all Direct Student Loans and federally-managed Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFEL ) loans . Any months in which borrowers made payments will count toward IDR, regardless of repayment plan. Payments made prior to consolidation on consolidated loans will also count. This fix is necessary to correct for data problems and past implementation inaccuracies. Any borrower who has made the required number of payments for IDR forgiveness based on this payment-count revision will receive loan cancellation automatically. Additionally, FSA will count months spent in deferment prior to XXXX toward IDR forgiveness ( with the exception of in-school deferment ) for this same population of borrowers to address concerns that, prior to that date, its data can not distinguish IDR-eligible deferments from other deferments.

Permanently Fix IDR Payment Counting by Reforming FSA 's IDR Tracking Borrowers should be able to rely on FSA and its loan servicers to keep accurate records of their progress toward forgiveness through IDR plans. FSA will issue new guidance to student loan servicers to ensure accurate and uniform payment counting practices, and it will track payment counts in its own modernized data systems. In XXXX, FSA will begin displaying IDR payment counts on StudentAid.gov so borrowers can view their progress after logging into their accounts. In addition, the Department plans to revise the terms of IDR through rulemaking to further simplify payment counting by allowing more loan statuses to count toward IDR forgiveness, including certain types of deferments and forbearances.

FSA will begin implementing these changes immediately, but borrowers may not see the effect in their accounts until the last quarter of XXXX. ''",None,Servicer under contract with Federal Student Aid,FL,32205,None,Consent provided,Web,01/15/25,Untimely response,No,N/A,11549338

Also, I received confirmation from Aidvantage during that time that they received the 1099C form, however instead of processing the form and discharging the student loan debt, Aidvantage disregarded the 1099C and approved the student loan for forbearance, this is clearly fraud. The 1099C form was originally supposed to be received by the CFO of Maximus Inc. In order to be clear with this matter, I will need Aidvantage dba Maximus Inc. CFO to answer the following questions : ( 1 ) According to the alleged loan agreement was Aidvantage involved in the alleged loan to lend their money as adequate consideration to purchase the promissory note from me? YES or NO. ( 2 ) Did Aidvantage involved in the alleged loan follow GAAP? YES or NO. ( 3 ) Was it the intent of the alleged loan agreement that the one who funded the loan is to be repaid the money? YES or NO. ( 4 ) According to the alleged loan agreement was the alleged borrower to provide anything of value that Aidvantage would use to give value to the promissory note in approximately the amount of the alleged loan? YES or NO. ( 5 ) According to the bookkeeping entries of Aidvantage in the alleged loan, did Aidvantage involved in the alleged student loan lend their money as adequate consideration lent to purchase the promissory note from me? YES or NO. ( 6 ) Are the economics of the alleged loan similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling against the borrower? YES or NO. ( 7 ) According to the alleged loan agreement was the alleged borrower to lend the borrower 's promissory note to another party such as Aidvantage? YES or NO.

01/03/25,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"On XX/XX/year>, I went to aidvantage.com to pay off XXXX student loans. These were XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. I paid them with {$9600.00}. At that time, I took extra care to ensure that I entered in the total full balance noted for the full amount of each loan, down to the cent. This was completed within their loan specification feature. 4 days later, I saw that the loans had still not cleared from my account and it was showing that my account still had very small interest amounts due on each of them. On XX/XX/year>, I called to inquire why the company had not discharged the loans from my account and why it was still showing that I owed money. The representative could not provide me with a clear answer. Please pull this call recording, because you will hear the representative talk about what she sees in the account and she could not clearly state why it was still showing interest on my account. Additionally, the amount of money owed on these loans have since increased since this call. When I called, one of the loans had a {$2.00} balance and it has not magically increased, because I no longer see that balance on any of the loans. She stated that they had a certain amount of time before the loans would show discharged and that I would get a letter stating the loans had been released or discharged. In the past when I have cleared loans, they did NOT send a letter to state that my loans had been discharged. I have never received this information from Aidvantage. Since my loans moved to aidvantage, I completely paid off loan XXXX, and instead of receiving discharge, they magically added on a few dollars to the account. 

The biggest issue is that they have added a collective of {$180.00} to all XXXX of my loans, which collectively, originally had a balance of {$9600.00}. I know that I took extreme care to enter what they noted as the total account balance. I also called an additional time sometime in XXXX to inquire, once again, about why the status of my loans had not changed, and the representative could not provide me with any specific information about why this was the case.If you listen to that call, the lady stated that I would receive an email from their team from the escalation of the issue, but I have still yet to receive this email. 

Today, I spoke with an escalation specialist at Aidvantage ( name has been redacted for privacy, but can be provided upon request ) and she maintained that the account balance currently listed on the account is correct. She claims that on XX/XX/year>, the balance currently listed was the same, however, I am 100 % sure that I entered the total due amount that was listed for each and every loan that I paid toward on XX/XX/XXXX, because I wanted to avoid this predatory practice of hidden fees being added on after the fact. I believe they did this to savor the opportunity to add on additional interest to my account or their record keeping practices are not up to par. Aidvantage needs to make this right by crediting the balance between what I paid, which was XXXX, and the new balance amount they are stating I have to pay. I am going to pay the difference now, because I do not know how much power Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has in rectifying this matter, and I do not want the balance to continue to increase via interest, but Aidvantage is criminal and in due time, a thorough investigation into their IT and record keeping practices will show that.",None,"Maximus Federal Services, Inc.",MD,21075,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,01/03/25,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,11372618

This claim, widely advertised in national campaigns and direct mailings, was later revealed to be grossly inaccurate. XXXX included old jobs held by mid-career students before enrolling and excluded graduates who found employment outside their field of study. 
At its peak, XXXX enrolled nearly XXXX students across campuses in XXXX states and through an online program accessible nationwide. The scale of this deception has left countless students burdened with unmanageable debt and limited opportunities, as documented in the Department of Educations Borrower Defense Executive Summary and Statements of Facts.

We are asking you to take immediate steps to : 1. Approve all outstanding Borrower Defense applications for students who attended these institutions.

2. Discharge all loans associated with fraudulent practices, including consolidated loans.

3. Repair borrowers credit reports to reflect the removal of these fraudulent debts. 
Delaying action only prolongs the harm caused by these predatory institutions, leaving borrowers unable to move forward with their lives. Many of us pursued higher education to achieve the American Dream, but this dream was stolen by the very institutions we trusted to help us achieve it.
